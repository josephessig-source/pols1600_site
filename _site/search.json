It is computing intensive, and, as such, will enable students to execute basic quantitative analyses of social science data using the linear model with statistical inference arising from re-sampling and permutation based techniques as applied in the R statistical computing language with RStudio. By the end of the course, a successful student will be able to find social science data online, download it, analyze it, and write about how the analyses bear on focused social science or policy questions.\n\n\n\nMore than anything I assume a willingness to engage with mathematics, data analysis, computer programming, and the practice of social science thinking and writing. I also assume you’ve taken at least one class in algebra at the level taught in most high schools in the United States and have used a personal computer to read and type email and other documents and have some experience with the Internet.\nI also assume that you will read the syllabus and that you keep up to date on changes in the syllabus which will be announced in class.

The Brown Writing Center defines plagiarism as ``appropriating another person’s ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source.’’ The consequences for plagiarism are often severe, and can include suspension or expulsion. This course will follow the guidelines in the Academic Code for determining what is and isn’t plagiarism:\n\nIn preparing assignments a student often needs or is required to employ outside sources of information or opinion. All such sources should be listed in the bibliography. Citations and footnote references are required for all specific facts that are not common knowledge and about which there is not general agreement. New discoveries or debatable opinions must be credited to the source, with specific references to edition and page even when the student restates the matter in his or her own words. Word-for-word inclusion of any part of someone else’s written or oral sentence, even if only a phrase or sentence, requires citation in quotation marks and use of the appropriate conventions for attribution. Citations should normally include author, title, edition, and page. (Quotations longer than one sentence are generally indented from the text of the essay, without quotation marks, and identified by author, title, edition, and page.) Paraphrasing or summarizing the contents of another’s work is not dishonest if the source or sources are clearly identified (author, title, edition, and page), but such paraphrasing does not constitute independent work and may be rejected by the instructor. Students who have questions about accurate and proper citation methods are expected to consult reference guides as well as course instructors.\n\nWe will discuss specific information about your written work in class in more detail, but if you are unsure of how to properly cite material, please ask for clarification. If you are having difficulty with writing or would like more information or assistance, consult the Writing Center, the Brown library and/or the Academic Code for more information.\n\n\n\nAll students and the instructor must be respectful of others in the classroom.

In terms of participation, I expect that you will come to class eager to learn and engage with that week’s topics. If you have a question, ask it. If you’re getting an error, share it. In some ways, your job is to make errors. To paraphrase Joyce: people of genius make no mistakes. Our errors are volitional and portals of discovery. While this experience can be challenging and frustrating, it is also incredibly rewarding. I fully expect you persevere through the problems and difficulties that inevitably arise in this course, and will do everything I can to help in this process."

Similarly, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the true coefficient on partisanship in this model is 0 as the test statistic for this estimate ( -1.38) corresponds to a p-value of 0.168 suggesting that we would see test statistics this large or larger fairly often when the true relationship was 0.\nIn some the results from Model 1 provide little support for any of the expectations described by H1"

    "text": "Lab: Questions 6-10: Simple Linear Regression\n\nIn question 6, you will see how calculating conditional means provides a simple test of “Red Covid” claim.\nIn question 7, you will see how a linear model returns the same information as these conditional means (in a sligthly different format)\nIn question 8, you will get practice interpreting linear models with continuous predictors (i.e. predictors that take on a range of values)\nIn question 9, you will get practice visualizing these models and using the figures help interpret your results substantively.\nQuestion 10 asks you to play the role of a skeptic and consider what other factors might explain the relationships we found in Questions 6-9. We will explore these factors in next week’s lab."

Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\nIn this lab, we’ll reproduce some basic evidence of this phenomena, using bivariate linear regression as a tool to summarize and describe relationships.\nNext week, we’ll see how multiple regression (linear regression with multiple predictors) can be used to assess alternative explanations for the patterns we see.\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\nSet up our work space (2-3 Minutes)\nLoad data on Covid-19 and the 2020 Election.

To do this, we need to transform our election data, which is structured by candidate-state-election, into a data set that contains the election results by state for 2020.\nUsing the code from this slide transform pres_df to create a new data frame called pres2020_df by\n\nCreating a copy of the year variable called year_election\n\nThis is a stupid technical thing for merging later…\n\nTaking the state variable which was ALLCAPS and turning into Title Case using the str_to_title() function\nChanging the observations of state which are now \"District Of Columbia\" to \"District Of Columbia\"\nFiltering the data to include only candidates from the Democratic and Republican Parties\nFiltering the data to inlcude only the results from the 2020 election.\nSelecting the state, state_po, year_election, party_simplified, candidatevotes and totalvotes columns from pres_df\nPivoting the candidatevotes into two new columns with names from the party_simplified column\nCreating measures of the Democratic (dem_voteshare)and Republican (rep_voteshare) canditdates’ vote shares in each state by dividing the new DEMOCRAT and REPUBLICAN columns by the values from the totalvotes column\nCreating a variable called winner which takes a value of \"Trump\" if the rep_voteshare variable for a state is greater than the dem_voteshare for a state.\nMaking the winner variable a factor, with Trump as the first level and Biden as the second level\n\nThis is a trick for ggplot so that if we want to use winner to color points on a scatter plot, the points for Trump observations will show up as red and the points for Biden observations will show as blue.\n\nSaving the output of these transformations to an data frame called pres2020_df\n\nWhich, I know sounds like a lot, but…\nAll you need to do is copy and paste the code from this slide.\n\n# Transform Presidential Election data\npres_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year_election = year,\n    state = str_to_title(state),\n    # Fix DC\n    state = ifelse(state == \"District Of Columbia\", \"District of Columbia\", state)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(party_simplified %in% c(\"DEMOCRAT\",\"REPUBLICAN\"))%&gt;%\n  filter(year == 2020) %&gt;%\n  select(state, state_po, year_election, party_simplified, candidatevotes, totalvotes\n         ) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = party_simplified,\n              values_from = candidatevotes) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    dem_voteshare = DEMOCRAT/totalvotes*100,\n    rep_voteshare = REPUBLICAN/totalvotes*100,\n    winner = forcats::fct_rev(factor(ifelse(rep_voteshare &gt; dem_voteshare,\"Trump\",\"Biden\")))\n  ) -&gt; pres2020_df"

This difference reflects the fact that Biden tended to win more populous states than trump, so simply looking at the average number of new deaths is bit misleading. Comparing 7-day averages per 100,000 residents adjusts for differences in population between Red and Blue States.\nWhen we limit our analysis, to just observations before April 19, 2021, the difference in the 7-day average rate of new Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 residents is relatively small (0.02 more deaths per 100,000 residents in Red States)\nWhen we look at observations after the vaccine became widely available the difference is more than 6 times as big (0.125 more deaths per 100,000 residents in Red States)"

Then, I’ll need to get the data. And then…”)\n\nThink and write programmatically\n\nIn this .Rmd file, I’ll first ask you to outline, conceptually, all the steps you’ll need to do to produce this figure.\nDon’t worry if you can’t think of all the necessary steps or aren’t sure of the order. We’ll produce a collective outline of what we need to do before getting to the actual coding\nWhen we do code, I’ll ask you to organize your code as outlined below:\n\nSeparate your steps into sections using the # headers in Markdown\nWrite a brief overview in words that a normal human can understand, what the code in that section is doing\nPaste the code for that section into a code chunk\nAdd brief comments to this code to help your reader understand what’s happening\nKnit your document after completing each section.\n\n\nMapping concepts to code\n\nAgain you shouldn’t have to write much code. Just copy and paste from the labs and slides.\nYour goal for today is to interpret that code and develop a mental map that allows you to say when I want to do this type of task (say “recode data”), I need to use some combination of these functions (%&gt;%, mutate(), maybe group_by() or case_when())\nBut shouldn’t we be writing our own code?! Yes. Sure. Eventually.\nThe tutorials give you practice writing single commands, and by the end of the class you should be able write this code like this for to accomplish similar tasks\nBut even then, you will not be writing code from memory. I still have to Google functions, and often search my old code to find a clever solution to task.\nEveryone starts learning to code by copying and pasting other people’s code.\nThis will help minimize (but not eliminate) syntactic errors, while over time we get better writing code from scratch and fixing errors as the develop.\n\nPractice wrangling data\n\nHow do you load data?\nHow do you look at data?\nHow do you transform data?\n\nPractice visualizing data\n\nUsing the grammar of graphics to translate raw data into visual graphics\nUnderstanding the components of this grammar:\n\ndata\naesthetics\ngeometries\nfacets\nstatistics\ncoordinates\nthemes\n\nExploring what happens when we change these components\n\n\nWe’ll work in pairs and periodically check in as a class to check our progress, review concepts, and share insights.\nFor fun, let’s say that the first group that successfully recreates this figure gets to choose one of the following non-monetary prizes:\n\nI’ll tell them a joke\nOne AMA I will answer truthfully\nOne question to be asked on the weekly class survey\n0.00001% extra credit added to their final grade for the course.\n\nIf we finish early, you’re free to go. If you want, we can take some time to explore some additional figures we might produce like maps or lollipop plots.\nOk, let’s begin!"

    "section": "6.3 Interperet results",
    "text": "6.3 Interperet results\nHere is my interpretation of the models:\nME: Our baseline model confirms our initial expectations. Controlling for race, older respondents have higher predicted levels of support for Trump by 0.002 percentage points. Controlling for race, the model predicts that a 60 year old respondent is about 6.3 percentage points more likely to vote for Trump than a 30 year-old respondent. The test statistic for this coefficient is 3.10 corresponding to a p-value &lt; 0.05, suggesting that if there were no relationship between age and vote choice in this model, it would be very unlikely that we observed a test statistic of this magnitude. Similarly the confidence interval for this estimate has suggests that coefficients as small as 0.0008 and as large as 0.0034 are plausible values for the relationship between age and vote choice in these data. Similarly, controlling for age, Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents report significantly lower levels of support for Trump than white respondents (p &lt; 0.05).\nTurning to the interaction model, we see that the magnitude of the coefficient on age (which corresponds to the marginal effect of age for white respondents) increases, while the coefficients on the interactions between age and racial indicators are generally negative, suggesting that the relationship between age and support for Trump is less strong for these racial and ethnic groups. Figure 1 helps clarify these marginal effects, as we see that slope for age is clearly positive for white respondents, clearly negative for Black respondents. The confidence intervals for the predicted values of the other racial and ethnic groups are generally wide, and consisent with positive, negative, or no relationship between age and vote choice.\nFinally, looking at the model controlling for partisanship, we see that none of the relationships between age, race, and vote choice, remain statistically significant once we account for the relationships between partisanship and vote choice, and the relationships between partisanship and age and race. In sum, apparent demographic differences in support for Trump appear driven by the differences in partisan identification across racial groups and within age groups.\nYOU:"

The typical respondent in the data was just under 50 years old, with some college, with an income in the range of $50k-$59k. Approximately two-thirds of the sample identified as white, with 13 percent of respondents identifying as Black, 13 percent as Hispanic, 2 percent as Asian. Forty-three percent of respondents identified as Democrats, 38 percent as Republicans, and 20 percent as Independents. The respondents were evenly split in who they would vote for 2024, with 50 percent saying they would Vote for Donald Trump, and 50 percent saying Joe Biden. In the 2020 campaign, the average respondent reported engaging in about 1 act of political participation."

For example, the appendix describes income as ranging from 1 (Under $10k) to 16 ($500k and above), when their code, implemented above produces 32 unique values, in part because the way the CPS asked and coded the income question changed overtime.

    "text": "Today we will explore the critiques and alternative explanations for the phenomena of “Red Covid” discussed by the NYT’s David Leonhardt in articles last fall here and more recently here.\nRecall the core thesis of Red Covid is something like the following:\n\nSince Covid-19 vaccines became widely available to the general public in the spring of 2021, Republicans have been less likely to get the vaccine. Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\n\nA skeptic of this claim might argue that relationship between electoral and epidemelogical outcomes is spurious, saying somthing like:\n\nThere are lots of ways that Red States differ from Blue States — demographics, economics, geography, culture, and so on – and it is these differences that explain the phenomena of Red Covid. If we were to control for these omitted variables the relationship between a state’s partisan leanings and Covid-19 would go away.\n\nIn this lab, we will see how we can explore these claims using multiple regression to control for competing explanations.\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\nGet set up to work (10 minutes)\n\nThen we will estimate and interpret a series of regression models:\n\nA baseline Red Covid model using simple bivariate regression using the Republican vote share of states to predict the 14-day average of per capita Covid-19 deaths on September 23, 2021 (10 Minutes)\nA multiple regression model controlling for Republican vote share the median age (15 minutes)\nA model controlling for Republican vote share, the median age and median income (15 minutes)\nA model controlling for Republican vote share, the median age median income and vaccination rates (15 minutes)\nA model using Republican vote share, the median age median income to predict vaccination rates (15 minutes)\n\nFinally, we’ll take the weekly survey which will serve as a mid semester check in.\nOne of these 6 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\nYou will work in your assigned groups. Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file of lab.\nThis lab must contain the names of the group members in attendance.\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\nHere are your assigned groups for the semester."

In sum, a p-value assess the likelihood of seeing what we did, if in fact, there was no relationship. If that likelihood is small (p&lt;0.05), we reject the claim of no relationship. We remain uncertain about the true value of the coefficient, but we are pretty confident it’s not 0.↩︎\nA standard error is another one of those things in the cart that we’re putting before the horse today.

Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\nIn this lab, we’ll reproduce some basic evidence of this phenomena, using bivariate linear regression as a tool to summarize and describe relationships.\nNext week, we’ll see how multiple regression (linear regression with multiple predictors) can be used to assess alternative explanations for the patterns we see.\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\nSet up our work space (2-3 Minutes)\nLoad data on Covid-19 and the 2020 Election.

When the variable facial_coverings equals 0, R will input the character string \"No policy\" into the face_masks variable.\nWhen the absolute value of facial_coverings equals 1 (i.e.facial_coverings equals 1 or -1 ), R will input the character string \"Recommended\" into the face_masks variable.

So by collapsing negative and positive values of facial_coverings to construct our face_mask variable, we’re probably over stating the extent the extensiveness of policies in effect.\nSo we should be cautious in how we interpret our collapsed variable, face_mask. Perhaps we could construct another variable that distinguished state-level policies from more localized policies, or we could only look at cases where there was a uniform state policy."

    "text": "8.1 Measures of Central Tendency\nMeasures of central tendency describe what a typical value of some variable. In this course, we’ll use three measures of what’s typical:\n\nmean\nmedian\nmode\n\n\n8.1.1 Mean\nOne of the most frequent measures of central tendency we’ll use in this course is a mean or average.\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations of some variable \\(x\\). We can calculate the mean of \\(\\bar{x}\\) (“x bar), by adding up all the values of x\n[ {x}=_{i=1}^n x_i ]\nWe’ll see later in the course that means are closely related to the concept of expected values in probability and that conditional means (which we’ll calculate below) are central to thinking about linear regression.\nFor now, please calculate the mean (average) number of new cases per 100,000 residents in our data:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 29.40619\n\n\nLast class, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a conditional mean the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.\nFormally, you’ll often see this written in terms of Expected Values: Something like\n[ E[Y|X=x] ]\nOr to make it more concrete:\n[ E[ | ] ]\nIn code, we could accomplish this manually, using the index operator:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"No policy\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.26168\n\n\n\n8.1.1.1 How would we calculate the conditional mean of new_cases_pc when face_masks equals “Recommend”\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"Recommended\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 16.61408\n\n\nBy using group_by() with summarise() we can accomplish this more quickly:\n\ncovid_us%&gt;%\n  group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  face_masks             new_cases_pc\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No policy                      10.3\n2 Recommended                    16.6\n3 Some requirements              36.2\n4 Required shared places         29.4\n5 Required all times             32.2\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of what’s typical for variables that take numeric values\nImagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value\nThe median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.1\nFormally, we can define that median as:\n[ M_x = X_i : ^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=^f_x(X)dx=1/2 ]\nWhich might look like Greek to you, which is fine. Just think of it as the middle value.\n\n8.1.2.1 Please calculate the median number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 using the median() function. How does it compare to the mean?\n\nmedian(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 11.70289\n\n\nInteresting the median is much lower than the mean. If we were to look at a histogram of our data (more on that next week; think of it as a graphical representation of a frequency table), we see that the new_cases_pc has a “long tail” or is skewed to the right. Most of the values are close to 0, but there are few cases that are extreme outliers.\n\n\nMedians are less influenced by outliers than means\n\n\n\nhist(covid_us$new_cases_pc, breaks = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Modes\nConceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome.\nModes are useful for describing what’s typical of “nominal” or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy.\nTo calculate the mode of our face_masks variable, wrap the output of table() with the sort() function\n\nsort(table(covid_us$face_masks))\n\n\n    Required all times              No policy            Recommended \n                  1032                   3893                   8879 \nRequired shared places      Some requirements \n                 15088                  24786 \n\n\nFor numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable’s density function (more on this later in the class).\nYou can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median’s and modes from this helpful figure from Wikipedia:"

I’m just contractually obligated to show you math.\n\n8.3.2.1 Calculate the correlation between the percent of state’s population that is fully vaccinated (percent_vaccinated) and new_cases_pc using the cor() function.\nYou’ll need to set the argument use=\"complete.obs\n\ncor(covid_us$percent_vaccinated, covid_us$new_cases_pc, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n[1] 0.008977781\n\n\nHmm… That seems a little strange.

    "text": "9.1 What do these averages really tell us?\nProbably not that much. Different Face mask policies are implemented at different times in the pandemic. For example, by 2021, almost all states have some requirements. Comparing the average for new cases in states with no policy to states with full requirements, is comparing the state of world in early 2020 to the state of the world in late 2020 to mid 2021. But lots of things differ between these periods. Other policies are also going into effect, new variants are emerging.\nIn short, those simple conditional means across the full data don’t really provide an apples to apples comparison.\n\ncovid_us%&gt;%\n  group_by(date,face_masks)%&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    n = n()\n  )%&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= \"2020-03-01\")%&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(date,n,fill=face_masks))+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'date'.

Lots of things are changing and these month comparisons are by no means perfect. Lot’s of things differ between states with different mask policies. What we’d really like to know is a sort of counterfactual comparison between the number new cases in a state with a given policy and what those new cases would have been had that state had a different policy.\nThe problem is, we don’t get to see that counterfactual outcome. So how can we make causal claims about the effects of facemasks, or any other policy that interests us? Finding creative ways to answer these questions is the key to making credible causal claims.\nNext week, we’ll explore how to make this figure and many more from our data"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Asking a good research question is one of the most important skills you will develop in your academic careers. It’s also one of the hardest.\nWe often think we’re asking one question, when in fact the study we conduct really addresses a related but distinct question. When a priest asked Willie Sutton why he robbed banks, he replied the “Well, that’s where the money is”. The priest’s question was about why rob at all, while Sutton answered the different question “Given one robs, why rob banks?” Similarly, Medieval philosophers might ask why objects stay in motion, while Newton suggests what really need is not an explanation of motion itself but of changes in motion.\nThe object of our question shapes the form of our explanation.\nIn this assignment, I would like your group to craft three potential research questions that we might explore in our research project for this class. Each question, should be a single sentence, with a few sentences answering the following questions (More details below):\n\nWhy do we care about the answer to this research question?\nWhat’s would a hypothetical “ideal experiment” to answer this question look like?\nWhat would a study with observational data look like?\nA published study that relates to this question\nHow feasible would it be to do a study like this for the course\n\nYou may use this Rmd file as a template (click here to download) or create your own file. Please submit your responses to Canvas.\nYou might start by writing down several questions of different forms about the same topic:\n\nWhy do people vote?\nWhy do people not vote?\nWhy do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor?\nWhen might people who don’t vote, be motivated to vote?\nWhat is the effect of encouraging someone to vote via a phone call?\nAre phone calls more or less effective than in-person contact for get-out the vote efforts?\n\nEach of these questions addresses a general topic that political scientists seem to think is important. Each carries some suppositions and assumptions that in turn influence the type of explanation we might find convincing. Why do people vote feels a bit broad to me. People probably vote for many reasons. How can we hope to adjudicate between all the possible reasons for voting? (Further are these the same reasons for not voting or do we need another set of explanations altogether?)\nWhether phone calls are more or less effective than in-person contacts for GOTV efforts seems more tractable, but also perhaps to narrow. Do we really care? If we’re confident we can identify an effect or difference in one study, are we sure we’ll see similar effects in a different study conducted under different circumstances?\nIn crafting your research questions, you want to strike a balance between things we actually care about (why do people vote) and things we can actually assess (what’s effect of a particularly type of encouragement to vote). A few thoughts on this process:\n\n“Why” questions tend to be more compelling than “What” or “How” or “Do” questions, I think in part because “why” questions often imply a theory and suggest a counterfactual (why this and not that), while other ways of asking questions feel more descriptive. For example, why do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor. Well, one explanation may be that their relative social and economic status means they are more likely to be targets of mobilization efforts by campaigns (among many things). So a natural follow up to this larger question might be, what’s the effect of providing similar mobilization efforts to the poor. Would they vote at similar rates to the rich? If so, then we’ve learned something about how mobilization explains class differences in participation.\nThinking about questions in terms of puzzles is another useful trick. Why do parties exist when politicians’ ideological preferences can explain the vast majority of their legislative behavior? Note this type of question contains a lot of presuppositions (how do we measure ideological preferences? Do they really explain legislative behavior? Is that what we care about?), but as point of departure for a study these type arguments can be useful\nTry to be simple and clear. Don’t worry about asking the perfect question right away. Your questions can and should evolve over time, and I suspect some of you will write a paper that has nothing to do with the questions you posed here.\n\nFor each question, please discuss the following:\n\nWhy do we care? Why we should care about the answer to this question. A strong justification is often that existing theories yield conflicting predictions and so your study will offer some insight into how to adjudicate betweeen these theories. A less strong justification is that no one has ever studied this before. Even if this is true (and it’s often not) it may be true for good reason. No need for formal citations, but if there are specific theories or claims your addressing feel free to name names.\nThe ideal experiment Please describe an “ideal” experiment that you could run that would give you some purchase on your question. Note the key feature of an experiment, is that you the researcher are able to manipulate (through random assignment) some facet of the world. Assume money, resources, physics, and even ethics are not an object. If you could randomly assign anything, what would you manipulate. At what level of analysis would your manipulation occur (i.e. are your units of analysis individuals or countries or something else). How would you measure your outcome, again assuming you were all power and all-seeing. If that manipulation isn’t feasible, what does that say about the ability to make a causal claim about your question?\nThe observational study Finally, considering some of the potential limitations that might prevent you from implementing your ideal experiment (it’s hard to randomly assign democratic government), what is one way you might address your research question with observational data. Would your study use cross-sectional or longitudinal data. What are some of the concerns (selection on observables) that arise in this setting. Is there a natural experiment or some sort of discontinuity you might leverage to approximate this experimental ideal.\n\nAgain, each paragraph should be brief and to the point. No need to specify a full research design–just give me the broad strokes. You’re writing for each question should not exceed a page.\nAfter you’ve thought through how you might go about answering your question, please find\n\nA published study that relates to this question. It need not be exactly your question as posed, but it should be in a similar area. Include a full citation, and link to the study. Then in a paragraph sentences try to summarize:\n\n\nThe study’s research question\nEmprical design\nCore findings.\n\nFinally on a scale of 1 (least feasible) to 10 (most feasible), please evaluate how likely you think it is you could write an empirical paper on this question for this course.\nDon’t worry about getting everything right. Your final projects can, will, and probably should change. The point of this exercise is to get some practice thinking about questions that interest you in the language of causal inference and potential outcomes."

Each question, should be a single sentence, with a few sentences answering the following questions (More details below):\n\nWhy do we care about the answer to this research question?\nWhat’s would a hypothetical “ideal experiment” to answer this question look like?\nWhat would a study with observational data look like?\nA published study that relates to this question\nHow feasible would it be to do a study like this for the course\n\nYou may use this .qmd file as a template (click here to download) or create your own file. Please submit your responses to Canvas.\nYou might start by writing down several questions of different forms about the same topic:\n\nWhy do people vote?\nWhy do people not vote?\nWhy do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor?\nWhen might people who don’t vote, be motivated to vote?\nWhat is the effect of encouraging someone to vote via a phone call?\nAre phone calls more or less effective than in-person contact for get-out the vote efforts?\n\nEach of these questions addresses a general topic that political scientists seem to think is important. Each carries some suppositions and assumptions that in turn influence the type of explanation we might find convincing. Why do people vote feels a bit broad to me. People probably vote for many reasons. How can we hope to adjudicate between all the possible reasons for voting? (Further are these the same reasons for not voting or do we need another set of explanations altogether?)\nWhether phone calls are more or less effective than in-person contacts for GOTV efforts seems more tractable, but also perhaps to narrow. Do we really care? If we’re confident we can identify an effect or difference in one study, are we sure we’ll see similar effects in a different study conducted under different circumstances?\nIn crafting your research questions, you want to strike a balance between things we actually care about (why do people vote) and things we can actually assess (what’s effect of a particularly type of encouragement to vote). A few thoughts on this process:\n\n“Why” questions tend to be more compelling than “What” or “How” or “Do” questions, I think in part because “why” questions often imply a theory and suggest a counterfactual (why this and not that), while other ways of asking questions feel more descriptive. For example, why do the rich vote at higher rates than the poor. Well, one explanation may be that their relative social and economic status means they are more likely to be targets of mobilization efforts by campaigns (among many things). So a natural follow up to this larger question might be, what’s the effect of providing similar mobilization efforts to the poor. Would they vote at similar rates to the rich? If so, then we’ve learned something about how mobilization explains class differences in participation.\nThinking about questions in terms of puzzles is another useful trick. Why do parties exist when politicians’ ideological preferences can explain the vast majority of their legislative behavior? Note this type of question contains a lot of presuppositions (how do we measure ideological preferences? Do they really explain legislative behavior? Is that what we care about?), but as point of departure for a study these type arguments can be useful\nTry to be simple and clear. Don’t worry about asking the perfect question right away. Your questions can and should evolve over time, and I suspect some of you will write a paper that has nothing to do with the questions you posed here.\n\nFor each question, please discuss the following:\n\nWhy do we care? Why we should care about the answer to this question. A strong justification is often that existing theories yield conflicting predictions and so your study will offer some insight into how to adjudicate betweeen these theories. A less strong justification is that no one has ever studied this before. Even if this is true (and it’s often not) it may be true for good reason. No need for formal citations, but if there are specific theories or claims your addressing feel free to name names.\nThe ideal experiment Please describe an “ideal” experiment that you could run that would give you some purchase on your question. Note the key feature of an experiment, is that you the researcher are able to manipulate (through random assignment) some facet of the world. Assume money, resources, physics, and even ethics are not an object. If you could randomly assign anything, what would you manipulate. At what level of analysis would your manipulation occur (i.e. are your units of analysis individuals or countries or something else). How would you measure your outcome, again assuming you were all power and all-seeing. If that manipulation isn’t feasible, what does that say about the ability to make a causal claim about your question?\nThe observational study Finally, considering some of the potential limitations that might prevent you from implementing your ideal experiment (it’s hard to randomly assign democratic government), what is one way you might address your research question with observational data. Would your study use cross-sectional or longitudinal data. What are some of the concerns (selection on observables) that arise in this setting. Is there a natural experiment or some sort of discontinuity you might leverage to approximate this experimental ideal.\n\nAgain, each paragraph should be brief and to the point. No need to specify a full research design–just give me the broad strokes. You’re writing for each question should not exceed a page.\nAfter you’ve thought through how you might go about answering your question, please find\n\nA published study that relates to this question. It need not be exactly your question as posed, but it should be in a similar area. Include a full citation, and link to the study. Then in a paragraph sentences try to summarize:\n\n\nThe study’s research question\nEmprical design\nCore findings.\n\nFinally on a scale of 1 (least feasible) to 10 (most feasible), please evaluate how likely you think it is you could write an empirical paper on this question for this course.\nDon’t worry about getting everything right. Your final projects can, will, and probably should change. The point of this exercise is to get some practice thinking about questions that interest you in the language of causal inference and potential outcomes.",

    "text": "8.1 Measures of Central Tendency\nMeasures of central tendency describe what a typical value of some variable. In this course, we’ll use three measures of what’s typical:\n\nmean\nmedian\nmode\n\n\n8.1.1 Mean\nOne of the most frequent measures of central tendency we’ll use in this course is a mean or average.\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations of some variable \\(x\\). We can calculate the mean of \\(\\bar{x}\\) (“x bar), by adding up all the values of x\n\\[\n\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n\\]\nWe’ll see later in the course that means are closely related to the concept of expected values in probability and that conditional means (which we’ll calculate below) are central to thinking about linear regression.\nFor now, please calculate the mean (average) number of new cases per 100,000 residents in our data:\nLast class, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a conditional mean the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.\nLater in the course we’ll talk about how we can use something like a mean to estimate an Expected Value: Something like\n\\[ E[Y|X=x] \\]\nOr to make it more concrete:\n\\[ E[\\text{New Cases} | \\text{Policy = \"recommended\"}] \\]\nIn code, we could accomplish this manually, using the index operator:\n\n# mean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"No policy\"], na.rm=T)\n\n\n8.1.1.1 How would we calculate the conditional mean of new_cases_pc when face_masks equals “Recommended”\nBy using group_by() with summarise() we can accomplish this more quickly:\n\n# covid_us%&gt;%\n#   group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%\n#   summarise(\n#     new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n#   )\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of what’s typical for variables that take numeric values\nImagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value\nThe median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.1\nFormally, we can define that median as:\n\\[\nM_x = X_i : \\int_{-\\infty}^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=\\int_{x_i}^\\infty f_x(X)dx=1/2\n\\]\nWhich might look like Greek to you, which is fine for now. Just think of it as the middle value.\n\n8.1.2.1 Please calculate the median number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 using the median() function. How does it compare to the mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nMedians are less influenced by outliers than means\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Modes\nConceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome.\nModes are useful for describing what’s typical of “nominal” or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy.\nTo calculate the mode of our face_masks variable, wrap the output of table() with the sort() function\n\n# sort(table(covid_us$face_masks))\n\nFor numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable’s density function (more on this later in the class).\nYou can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median’s and modes from this helpful figure from Wikipedia:"

Lots of things are changing and these month comparisons are by no means perfect. Lot’s of things differ between states with different mask policies. What we’d really like to know is a sort of counterfactual comparison between the number new cases in a state with a given policy and what those new cases would have been had that state had a different policy.\nThe problem is, we don’t get to see that counterfactual outcome. So how can we make causal claims about the effects of facemasks, or any other policy that interests us? Finding creative ways to answer these questions is the key to making credible causal claims.\nNext week, we’ll explore how to make this figure and many more from our data"

This difference reflects the fact that Biden tended to win more populous states than trump, so simply looking at the average number of new deaths is bit misleading. Comparing 7-day averages per 100,000 residents adjusts for differences in population between Red and Blue States.\nWhen we limit our analysis, to just observations before April 19, 2021, the difference in the 7-day average rate of new Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 residents is relatively small (0.02 more deaths per 100,000 residents in Red States)\nWhen we look at observations after the vaccine became widely available the difference is more than 6 times as big (0.125 more deaths per 100,000 residents in Red States)"

    "text": "Today we will explore the critiques and alternative explanations for the phenomena of “Red Covid” discussed by the NYT’s David Leonhardt in articles last fall here and more recently here.\nRecall the core thesis of Red Covid is something like the following:\n\nSince Covid-19 vaccines became widely available to the general public in the spring of 2021, Republicans have been less likely to get the vaccine. Lower rates of vaccination among Republicans have in turn led to higher rates of death from Covid-19 in Red States compared to Blue States.\n\nA skeptic of this claim might argue that relationship between electoral and epidemelogical outcomes is spurious, saying somthing like:\n\nThere are lots of ways that Red States differ from Blue States — demographics, economics, geography, culture, and so on – and it is these differences that explain the phenomena of Red Covid. If we were to control for these omitted variables the relationship between a state’s partisan leanings and Covid-19 would go away.\n\nIn this lab, we will see how we can explore these claims using multiple regression to control for competing explanations.\nTo accomplish this we will:\n\nGet set up to work (10 minutes)\n\nThen we will estimate and interpret a series of regression models:\n\nA baseline Red Covid model using simple bivariate regression using the Republican vote share of states to predict the 14-day average of per capita Covid-19 deaths on September 23, 2021 (10 Minutes)\nA multiple regression model controlling for Republican vote share the median age (15 minutes)\nA model controlling for Republican vote share, the median age and median income (15 minutes)\nA model controlling for Republican vote share, the median age median income and vaccination rates (15 minutes)\nA model using Republican vote share, the median age median income to predict vaccination rates (15 minutes)\n\nFinally, we’ll take the weekly survey which will serve as a mid semester check in.\nOne of these 6 tasks (excluding the weekly survey) will be randomly selected as the graded question for the lab.\n\nset.seed(3052025)\ngraded_question &lt;- sample(1:6,size = 1)\npaste(\"Question\",graded_question,\"is the graded question for this week\")\n\n[1] \"Question 5 is the graded question for this week\"\n\n\nYou will work in your assigned groups. Only one member of each group needs to submit the html file of lab.\nThis lab must contain the names of the group members in attendance.\nIf you are attending remotely, you will submit your labs individually.\nHere are your assigned groups for the semester."

States where more people voted for Trump in 2020 tend to have lower rates of vaccination. States with an older population, and a richer population tend to have higher rates of vaccination.\nThinking back to the previous models we’ve estimated, we might argue that the effects these predictors have on Covid-19 death rates is mediated through their relationship with vaccination rates.\nMore broadly, what does this analysis mean for arguments about Red Covid. I guess, I’d say it’s complicated. Vaccines are clearly effective at reducing Covid-19 deaths. In both aggregate and invidual level data, Republicans appear to be less willing to get vaccinated. But lots of other factors influence vaccination rates and public health more broadly.\nRegression is a tool for trying to explore these competing explanations, but without strong theory and clever design, it’s unlikely to resolve debates. There’s almost always a skeptic waiting to say “Yes, but have you controlled for …” We can try to address there concerns by controlling for more and more variables. But a better strategy is often to say, I don’t need to control for X because the logic of my design already accounts for X.\nStill it’s hard to think what that kind of design would be for something like for debates about Red Covid. Maybe we need different (individual data) or maybe we’d want to reframe the question or draw out further testable implications of the claim. If your group is looking for a final project, there are number of directions you could take this kind of analysis:\n\nLooking at different periods overtime\nLooking at smaller units of aggregation (counties)\nControlling for alternative factors\nLeveraging variation in the availability of vaccines over time and place."

A p-value is a conditional probability that arises from a hypothesis test summarizing the likelihood of observing a particular test statistic (here a regression coefficient, or more specifically, a t-statistic which is the regression coefficient divided by its standard error) given a paritcular hypothesis (typically, but not allows a null hypothesis that the true coefficient is 0). In sum, a p-value assess the likelihood of seeing what we did, if in fact, there was no relationship. If that likelihood is small (p&lt;0.05), we reject the claim of no relationship. We remain uncertain about the true value of the coefficient, but we are pretty confident it’s not 0.↩︎\nA standard error is another one of those things in the cart that we’re putting before the horse today. Briefly, it is an estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a coefficient and describes how much our coefficient might vary had we had a different sample…↩︎"

    "text": "3.4 Describe your results\nIn a few sentences, explain to your reader what these figures tell us about the data:\nFirst there is considerable variation in average rates of turnout across states. For example, across the years considered, the average turnout rate in West Virginia (a state which never implemented Same Day Registration) was about 46.8 percent among CPS respondents, while the average turnout rate in Minnesota (a state which had SDR for the entire period) was more than 20 percentage points higher (68.2 percent).\nSecond, there is also considerable variation in turnout across election years. Turnout in presidential elections is much higher than turnout in midterm elections. From one presidential or midterm election to the next, turnout rates can swing by as much as 10 percentage points. There does not seem to be a clear trend in turnout over time in these data.\nAs for variation in turnout by age before and after SDR, your interpretations depend on which state you chose. In states like New Hampshire or North Carolina, turnout seems markedly higher among young folks after the states adopted SDR.1 In states like Illinois or Wyoming, there doesn’t appear to be much of a difference.\n\n# Additional code to help me describe these figures\ndf_state %&gt;% \n  filter(turnout == min(turnout) | turnout == max(turnout))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  st    turnout\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 MN      0.682\n2 WV      0.468\n\ndf_year %&gt;% \n  group_by(election_type) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    swing = abs(turnout - lag(turnout))\n  ) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\n    sd = sd(turnout),\n    max_swing = max(swing, na.rm=T)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  election_type     sd max_swing\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 General       0.0293    0.0945\n2 Midterm       0.0287    0.102 \n\n\nHere’s the turnout by age plot for North Carolina\n\nsdr_age_df %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(age_group)) %&gt;% \n  filter(st == \"NC\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    age_group = factor(as.character(age_group))\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(year, turnout, col = SDR))+\n  geom_point()+\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = \"y~1\")+\n  facet_grid(~ age_group)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n   theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size =5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the same plot for Illinois\n\nsdr_age_df %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(age_group)) %&gt;% \n  filter(st == \"IL\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    age_group = factor(as.character(age_group))\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(year, turnout, col = SDR))+\n  geom_point()+\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = \"y~1\")+\n  facet_grid(~ age_group)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size =5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is a plot of the average turnout rates among 18-24 year olds over time in the 18 states that adopted SDR at some point between 1978-2018\n\nsdr_age_df %&gt;%\n  filter(age_group == \"18-24\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(year, turnout, col = SDR))+\n  geom_point()+\n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = \"y~1\", se = F)+\n  facet_wrap(~st , ncol = 3)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size =5))"

I’ll get you started:\nThe table presents the results of four regression models. The outcome in each model is a binary indicator of whether respondents to the CPS voted in a given election. The key predictor of interest in each model is the coefficient for sdr which corresponds the model’s predicted difference in turnout in states that had same day registration compared to states that did not. Model 1 presents the results from a simple linear regression assuming homoskedastic errors (i.e. constant error variance). The coefficient on sdr of 0.062 implies that this model predicts turnout will be higher by 6.2 percentage points in states with Same Day Registration. The standard error of 0.00110 is small relative to the coefficient, which as we will see in two weeks implies a statistically significant relationship.\nModel 2 presents the same specification, but uses robust standard errors that allow for non-constant (heteroskedastic) error variance. The coefficient on sdr is exactly the same as Model 1, and the standard error is similar to the ten-thousandth decimal place. In short, simply including robust standard errors does little to change our substantive interpretation.\nModel 3 includes fixed effects of state and year. Specifically, lm_robust() uses the within-in transformation via the method of alternating projections, subtracting off the state and year level means of the predictors and outcomes before estimating the regression. This transformation is equivalent to including indicator variables to represent the various levels of each fixed effect (e.g. including year and st as factor variables in the model). That latter, sometimes called the dummy variable approach, is more computationally intensive (if there are lots of levels to the fixed effect, the matrices involved in the calculation get very large), but as the code below demonstrates, they all yield the same estimates and standard errors (although there are some additional degrees of freedom adjustments that lm_robust() performs, which we are not when we calculate the within transformations by hand)\n\n# Kludge-y method of alternating projections....\ncps %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  # Only use observations from m3\n  filter(!is.na(dv_voted), !is.na(sdr)) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::group_by(st) %&gt;% \n  # Within transformation by states\n  mutate(\n    dv_voted_within = dv_voted - mean(dv_voted, na.rm=T),\n    sdr_within = sdr - mean(sdr, na.rm=T)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  # Within transformation by year\n  dplyr::group_by(year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    dv_voted_within = dv_voted_within - mean(dv_voted_within, na.rm=T),\n    sdr_within = sdr_within - mean(sdr_within,na.rm=T)\n  ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% \n  # Within transformation by year\n  dplyr::group_by(st) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    dv_voted_within = dv_voted_within - mean(dv_voted_within, na.rm=T),\n    sdr_within = sdr_within - mean(sdr_within,na.rm=T)\n  ) %&gt;% \n    dplyr::group_by(year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    dv_voted_within = dv_voted_within - mean(dv_voted_within, na.rm=T),\n    sdr_within = sdr_within - mean(sdr_within,na.rm=T)\n  ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% \n  dplyr::group_by(st) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    dv_voted_within = dv_voted_within - mean(dv_voted_within, na.rm=T),\n    sdr_within = sdr_within - mean(sdr_within,na.rm=T)\n  ) %&gt;% \n    dplyr::group_by(year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    dv_voted_within = dv_voted_within - mean(dv_voted_within, na.rm=T),\n    sdr_within = sdr_within - mean(sdr_within,na.rm=T)\n  ) %&gt;% ungroup()-&gt; cps\n\nstart_time_m3_within  &lt;- Sys.time()\nm3_within &lt;- lm_robust(dv_voted_within ~ sdr_within, \n                       cps,\n                       se_type = \"stata\",\n                       try_cholesky = T)\n\nend_time_m3_within  &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime_m3_within &lt;- round(end_time_m3_within - start_time_m3_within,5)\n\n\nstart_time_m3_indicator  &lt;- Sys.time()\nm3_indicator &lt;- lm_robust(dv_voted ~ sdr + factor(year) + factor(st),\n                          cps,\n                          se_type = \"stata\",\n                          try_cholesky = T)\nend_time_m3_indicator  &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime_m3_indicator &lt;- round(end_time_m3_indicator - start_time_m3_indicator,5)\n\ntime_m3_within\n\nTime difference of 1.42573 secs\n\ntime_m3_indicator\n\nTime difference of 4.27558 secs\n\n\n\nhtmlreg(list(m3, m3_within, m3_indicator),\n        omit.coef = \"factor|Intercept\",\n        digits = 5,\n        include.ci = F,\n        custom.model.names = c(\"lm_robust (within transformation)\",\"Within transformation by hand\",\"Indicator FE\")\n        ) %&gt;% HTML() %&gt;% browsable()\n\n\nStatistical models\n\n\n \nlm_robust (within transformation)\nWithin transformation by hand\nIndicator FE\n\n\n\n\nsdr\n0.00671***\n \n0.00671***\n\n\n \n(0.00185)\n \n(0.00185)\n\n\nsdr_within\n \n0.00671***\n \n\n\n \n \n(0.00185)\n \n\n\nR2\n0.02845\n0.00001\n0.02845\n\n\nAdj.

The coefficient on sdr remains the same as in Model 3, predicting about 0.6 percentage points higher turnout in states with same day registration. We see, however, that once we relax the assumption that our errors are independent, and allow for correlations between observations from the same state, our uncertainty about this estimate (quantified by its standard error) increases 10-fold, and we are non longer confident that there is a statistically significant relationship between same day registration and voting in these data.\nIn sum, once we account for fixed differences across states and between time periods, and allow correlated errors between observations from the same state, variation in the presence of same day registration laws seems to explain relatively little variation in voting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSo which model should we prefer? I would say the default approach of most social scientists is to prefer the most conservative estimate, which in this case corresponds to the results from model 4. We’d rather under claim than over claim. Since rarely if ever, do we know the right model , it’s generally common practice to report the results of multiple models with different specifications (as Grumbach and Hill do) as a way of demonstrating the robustness of ones’ results."

    "text": "6.3 Compare your figure to Figure 3 from the text\nFinally, write a few sentences comparing your results to those presented in Figure 3 of Grumbach and Hill.\nHere’s a snapshot of the relevant panels of Figure 3 for reference:\n\nPlease comment on the following:\n\nHow does the size (magnitude) of the marginal effects for 18-24 year olds compare to those reported in Figure 3?\nHow would you interpret this marginal effect substantively?\nAre any of the marginal effects in the model with no controls statistically significant?\n\nAnd if you’re interested, check out the comments for some further discussion about the differences between our replication and the published results.\n\nSo, I would say that the general constellation of results is similar to those in reported in the first two rows of the first column of Figure 3, but with some noticeable differences.\nAs with Grumbach and Hill’s Figure 3, the size of the marginal effect of SDR is generally largest for respondents in the 18-24-year-old age cohort. The model with no controls predicts that turnout among young folks will be about 2.6 percentage points higher in states with SDR. Including demographic and socio-economic controls, that estimate rises to about 4.6 percentage points.\nHowever, none of the marginal effects appear statistically significant in the model with no controls (all the CIs include 0). In the model with controls, the marginal effect for 18-24 year olds remains statistically significant, while the confidence interval on the marginal effect for 25-34 now includes 0 (i.e. is no longer statistically significant, or maybe is only marginally significant). Further, the specific point estimates differ in our replication from the results reported in the appendix of Grumbach and Hill\nSo what’s going on?\nDifferences in recoding If you dive into the replication code for the paper, you’ll note that their are some differences in how we recoded variables. In particular, our age_group variable classifies people in the 18-24 cohort, if their reported age is 18 to 24 when they took the survey. In the original paper, 18-24 year olds are coded with the following:\n\n#| eval: false\n# cps$age_group[cps$age&lt;=24] &lt;- \"18-24\"\n\nSo young folks below the age of 18 are included in this measure, which wouldn’t alter the estimates if they didn’t report voting, but it turns out that 7,991 folks in the CPS reported voting even though their recorded age is under 18.\n\ntable(cps$dv_voted, cps$age &lt; 18)\n\n   \n      FALSE    TRUE\n  0  876904    7991\n  1 1103606       0\n\n\nThese respondents are included in G&H’s analysis, but excluded from ours.\nThere are also some differences in the way we recoded covariates, like income and education that might also contribute to some of the differences we see in the model with controls.\nDifferences in standard errors The second main difference between the paper and our replication, is how we calculate the standard error for the marginal effect of Same Day Registration for a given age group.\nIn G&H, based on the 100 or so lines of code from line 662 it looks like they’re constructing confidence intervals around the estimates of the marginal effects, using the SEs for the interaction terms. But as discussed above, the correct standard errors need to be calculated from the variances and covariances of both the coefficients on sdr and sdr’s interaction with a specific age_group indicator. Doing so generally gives us wider confidence intervals, which likely explains the difference in the model with controls for 25-34 year-olds.\nWhat does it all mean?\nI guess I would say something like the following: Errors in code happen which is why it is doing empirical research in a reproducible way – sharing your data and code – is so vital.\nIn the present case, the errors seem to me to be relatively minor (some quibbles about how variables were recoded, a different approach to calculating standard errors) – such that the core finding, SDR has a bigger impact on young folks than old folks– remains relatively unchanged. Of course, we’ve only replicated two of 9 models in figure 3, but I suspect we’d find similar results. Further, Figure 3, is only one piece of evidence in their larger argument.\nSo even though we’ve uncovered some irregularities in how data were coded and standard errors calculated, I would caution against jumping to the conclusion that we’ve disproved or invalidated the paper. We haven’t.\nBut hopefully we’ve gotten a sense of how important it is to work in a clear manner. To check and double check our results. To know our data (e.g. do folks who legally can’t vote, report voting in the data?) To make sure our code is clean, easy to follow, and does what we think it does.\nFinally, I hope that in looking at the data by state and year and age group, we’ve gained a better sense of what fixed effects regression is trying to accomplish. Broadly, we’re taking into account variation across states and time periods, and then seeing if the thing we’re interested – Same Day Registration – still explains variation voting. These models are motivated by the same logic of the difference-in-differences designs we talked about in class. The interpretation of these regressions becomes more complicated (and their similarity to the the canonical DiD more tenuous), when “treatment” is implemented at different time periods, as well as when states can go from being not treated, to treated, back to not-treated, like Ohio, not to mention the fact that these models also introduce interactions between SDR and age groups to test for heterogeneous effects."

    "text": "6.3 Interpret the results of your table.\nPlease write a few sentences that provide a substantive interpretation of your table of descriptive statistics\nYour reader should come away with an understanding of the characteristics of the respondents to this sample.\nThe National Election Study’s 2024 Pilot Study contains responses from 1909 individuals2. The typical respondent in the data was just under 50 years old, with some college, with an income in the range of $50k-$59k. Approximately two-thirds of the sample identified as white, with 13 percent of respondents identifying as Black, 13 percent as Hispanic, 2 percent as Asian. Forty-three percent of respondents identified as Democrats, 38 percent as Republicans, and 20 percent as Independents. The respondents were evenly split in who they would vote for 2024, with 50 percent saying they would Vote for Donald Trump, and 50 percent saying Joe Biden. In the 2020 campaign, the average respondent reported engaging in about 1 act of political participation.\n\nNote, that technically, 024 Pilot Study contains three types of respondents described by sample_type:\n\n1,500 respondents who are part of a weighted sample that generalizes to the U.S. population\n113 respondents who completed the survey, but were not included in the panel-matching procedure used to construct construct a representative sample\n296 respondents who didn’t complete the whole survey.\n\nSo, technically speaking3, if we wanted to draw inferences about the proportion of American’s planning to to vote for Trump or Biden in 2024, we should only look at the 1,500 respondents in the weighted sample, and we should calculate that proportion using the sampling weights provided by weights.\nSurvey weights are complicated things, but the basically idea is that each observation is the sample is representative of observations in the population. Some types of observations will be over-represented in our sample – these are given smaller weights – while others are under-represented – these are given greater weights.\nQuick look at the highest and lowest survey weights seems to suggest to me that weighting procedure is giving more weight to respondents with lower levels of education, and income, and less weight to higher incomes and education levels.\n\ndf %&gt;% filter(\n weight &gt; quantile(weight, .99, na.rm=T)\n ) %&gt;% \n  select(weight, gender, age, race_5cat, education, income, partyid)\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 7\n   weight gender       age race_5cat education                income    partyid \n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;                &lt;dbl+lbl&gt; &lt;dbl+lb&gt;\n 1   7.00 1 [Male]      23 Hispanic  3 [Some college]          4 [$30,…  3 [Lea…\n 2   3.33 1 [Male]      31 Other     2 [High school graduate] NA         2 [Not…\n 3   2.96 2 [Female]    33 Hispanic  1 [No HS credential]     NA         4 [Ind…\n 4   3.36 1 [Male]      68 Black     3 [Some college]         NA         4 [Ind…\n 5   2.94 1 [Male]      67 Hispanic  1 [No HS credential]      2 [$10,…  2 [Not…\n 6   4.13 1 [Male]      22 Hispanic  3 [Some college]         11 [$120…  4 [Ind…\n 7   3.64 2 [Female]    58 Black     5 [4-year degree]         6 [$50,… NA      \n 8   3.30 1 [Male]      43 Hispanic  5 [4-year degree]         7 [$60,…  4 [Ind…\n 9   3.51 1 [Male]      69 White     2 [High school graduate]  4 [$30,…  7 [Str…\n10   3.32 1 [Male]      74 White     2 [High school graduate]  6 [$50,…  3 [Lea…\n11   3.32 1 [Male]      69 White     2 [High school graduate]  3 [$20,…  4 [Ind…\n12   3.51 1 [Male]      75 White     2 [High school graduate]  2 [$10,…  7 [Str…\n13   2.93 1 [Male]      41 Black     4 [2-year degree]         4 [$30,…  2 [Not…\n14   4.20 2 [Female]    63 Black     6 [Post-grad]             3 [$20,…  6 [Not…\n15   3.32 1 [Male]      67 White     2 [High school graduate]  5 [$40,…  3 [Lea…\n\ndf %&gt;% filter(\n  weight &lt; quantile(weight, .01, na.rm=T)\n) %&gt;% \n  select(weight, gender, age, race_5cat, education, income, partyid)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 7\n   weight gender       age race_5cat education                income     partyid\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;                &lt;dbl+lbl&gt;  &lt;dbl+l&gt;\n 1  0.314 1 [Male]      77 Black     6 [Post-grad]            10 [$100,… 1 [Str…\n 2  0.409 2 [Female]    29 Black     6 [Post-grad]            14 [$250,… 1 [Str…\n 3  0.382 1 [Male]      23 Hispanic  5 [4-year degree]        10 [$100,… 5 [Lea…\n 4  0.439 2 [Female]    26 Asian     5 [4-year degree]        12 [$150,… 2 [Not…\n 5  0.421 2 [Female]    57 Hispanic  6 [Post-grad]             6 [$50,0… 5 [Lea…\n 6  0.415 2 [Female]    52 Hispanic  6 [Post-grad]             6 [$50,0… 3 [Lea…\n 7  0.455 1 [Male]      72 Other     6 [Post-grad]             7 [$60,0… 7 [Str…\n 8  0.405 1 [Male]      32 Hispanic  5 [4-year degree]        11 [$120,… 4 [Ind…\n 9  0.362 2 [Female]    33 Black     5 [4-year degree]         1 [Less … 1 [Str…\n10  0.411 1 [Male]      42 Black     2 [High school graduate]  4 [$30,0… 4 [Ind…\n11  0.362 2 [Female]    33 Black     5 [4-year degree]         1 [Less … 1 [Str…\n12  0.346 1 [Male]      71 Black     6 [Post-grad]             2 [$10,0… 1 [Str…\n\n\nSampling weights are a can worms we won’t deal with in this class.

Hispanic and Asian respondents have the youngest median age of (40 years). Whites are also tend to lean more Republican in their partisanship than other racial minority groups. This is particularly true for older whites in the sample. Interestingly, average partisanship stays roughly constant with age for Asians and Hispanics, but older Black respondents are more likely to identify as Democrats than younger Blacks, whose partisan identification is more independent.\nPlease produce your own figure and provide a similar interpretation of what it conveys."

Forty-three percent of respondents identified as Democrats, 38 percent as Republicans, and 20 percent as Independents. The respondents were evenly split in who they would vote for 2024, with 50 percent saying they would Vote for Donald Trump, and 50 percent saying Joe Biden.

I expect all of these coefficients to be negative.\nTo explore whether the relationship between age and vote choice varies by race, I will fit an interaction model:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 age + \\sum\\beta_k race_k + \\epsilon + \\sum\\beta_{jk} age \\times race_k  + \\epsilon\n\\] This model allows the relationship between age and vote choice to vary by race.

For racial minorities, the marginal effect of age for the racial or ethnic group \\(k\\) is described by \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_{jk}\\). In general, I expect that the coefficients on \\(\\beta_{jk}\\) to be negative such that older racial minorities are less likely to support Trump than older white respondents.\nFinally, I will estimate a model that controls for partisanship.

    "text": "6.3 Interperet results\nME: Our baseline model confirms our initial expectations. Controlling for race, older respondents have higher predicted levels of support for Trump by 0.002 percentage points. Controlling for race, the model predicts that a 60 year old respondent is about 6.3 percentage points more likely to vote for Trump than a 30 year-old respondent. The test statistic for this coefficient is 3.10 corresponding to a p-value &lt; 0.05, suggesting that if there were no relationship between age and vote choice in this model, it would be very unlikely that we observed a test statistic of this magnitude. Similarly the confidence interval for this estimate has suggests that coefficients as small as 0.0008 and as large as 0.0034 are plausible values for the relationship between age and vote choice in these data. Similarly, controlling for age, Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents report significantly lower levels of support for Trump than white respondents (p &lt; 0.05).\nTurning to the interaction model, we see that the magnitude of the coefficient on age (which corresponds to the marginal effect of age for white respondents) increases, while the coefficients on the interactions between age and racial indicators are generally negative, suggesting that the relationship between age and support for Trump is less strong for these racial and ethnic groups. Figure 1 helps clarify these marginal effects, as we see that slope for age is clearly positive for white respondents, clearly negative for Black respondents. The confidence intervals for the predicted values of the other racial and ethnic groups are generally wide, and consisent with positive, negative, or no relationship between age and vote choice.\nFinally, looking at the model controlling for partisanship, we see that none of the relationships between age, race, and vote choice, remain statistically significant once we account for the relationships between partisanship and vote choice, and the relationships between partisanship and age and race. In sum, apparent demographic differences in support for Trump appear driven by the differences in partisan identification across racial groups and within age groups.\nYOU:"

Perhaps we could construct another variable that distinguished state-level policies from more localized policies, or we could only look at cases where there was a uniform state policy."

    "text": "8.1 Measures of Central Tendency\nMeasures of central tendency describe what a typical value of some variable. In this course, we’ll use three measures of what’s typical:\n\nmean\nmedian\nmode\n\n\n8.1.1 Mean\nOne of the most frequent measures of central tendency we’ll use in this course is a mean or average.\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations of some variable \\(x\\). We can calculate the mean of \\(\\bar{x}\\) (“x bar), by adding up all the values of x\n[ {x}=_{i=1}^n x_i ]\nWe’ll see later in the course that means are closely related to the concept of expected values in probability and that conditional means (which we’ll calculate below) are central to thinking about linear regression.\nFor now, please calculate the mean (average) number of new cases per 100,000 residents in our data:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 28.11486\n\n\nLast class, when we calculated the the average number of new cases under each type of face mask policy, we were calculating a conditional mean the mean of some variable, conditional on some other variable taking a specific value.\nFormally, you’ll often see this written in terms of Expected Values: Something like\n[ E[Y|X=x] ]\nOr to make it more concrete:\n[ E[ | ] ]\nIn code, we could accomplish this manually, using the index operator:\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"No policy\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.26168\n\n\n\n8.1.1.1 How would we calculate the conditional mean of new_cases_pc when face_masks equals “Recommend”\n\nmean(covid_us$new_cases_pc[covid_us$face_masks == \"Recommended\"], na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 16.61408\n\n\nBy using group_by() with summarise() we can accomplish this more quickly:\n\ncovid_us%&gt;%\n  group_by(face_masks)%&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    new_cases_pc = mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  face_masks             new_cases_pc\n  &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No policy                      10.3\n2 Recommended                    16.6\n3 Some requirements              36.2\n4 Required shared places         29.4\n5 Required all times             32.2\n6 &lt;NA&gt;                           11.8\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Median\nThe median is another measure of what’s typical for variables that take numeric values\nImagine, we took our data new Covid-19 cases and arranged them in ascending order, from the smallest value to highest value\nThe median would be the value in the exact middle of that sequence, also known as the 50th percentile.1\nFormally, we can define that median as:\n[ M_x = X_i : ^{x_i} f_x(X)dx=^f_x(X)dx=1/2 ]\nWhich might look like Greek to you, which is fine. Just think of it as the middle value.\n\n8.1.2.1 Please calculate the median number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 using the median() function. How does it compare to the mean?\n\nmedian(covid_us$new_cases_pc, na.rm=T)\n\n[1] 10.52355\n\n\nInteresting the median is much lower than the mean. If we were to look at a histogram of our data (more on that next week; think of it as a graphical representation of a frequency table), we see that the new_cases_pc has a “long tail” or is skewed to the right. Most of the values are close to 0, but there are few cases that are extreme outliers.\n\n\nMedians are less influenced by outliers than means\n\n\n\nhist(covid_us$new_cases_pc, breaks = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Modes\nConceptually, a mode describes the most frequent outcome.\nModes are useful for describing what’s typical of “nominal” or categorical data like our measure of face mask policy.\nTo calculate the mode of our face_masks variable, wrap the output of table() with the sort() function\n\nsort(table(covid_us$face_masks))\n\n\n    Required all times              No policy            Recommended \n                  1032                   3893                   8879 \nRequired shared places      Some requirements \n                 15088                  24786 \n\n\nFor numeric data, modes correspond to the peak of a variable’s density function (more on this later in the class).\nYou can get a sense of the relationship between, means, median’s and modes from this helpful figure from Wikipedia:\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg/240px-Visualisation_mode_median_mean.svg.png\")"

Lots of things are changing and these month comparisons are by no means perfect. Lot’s of things differ between states with different mask policies. What we’d really like to know is a sort of counterfactual comparison between the number new cases in a state with a given policy and what those new cases would have been had that state had a different policy.\nThe problem is, we don’t get to see that counterfactual outcome. So how can we make causal claims about the effects of facemasks, or any other policy that interests us? Finding creative ways to answer these questions is the key to making credible causal claims.\nNext week, we’ll explore how to make this figure and many more from our data"

Things like for() loops, functions() and apply() can reduce the amount of copying, pasting and replacing you have to do, which in turn can reduce the amount of errors induced by forgetting to change a variable name, or mistyping a command.\nBut the first time you see a for loop, or define your own function, it will likely seem a bit abstract, and obtuse.That’s ok. The goal is that you have a better, if not perfect, understanding of these concepts which we will use throughout the course."

Similarly, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the true coefficient on partisanship in this model is 0 as the test statistic for this estimate ( -1.38) corresponds to a p-value of 0.168 suggesting that we would see test statistics this large or larger fairly often when the true relationship was 0.\nIn sum, the results from Model 1 provide little support for any of the expectations described by H1"

Similarly, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the true coefficient on partisanship in this model is 0 as the test statistic for this estimate ( -1.38) corresponds to a p-value of 0.168 suggesting that we would see test statistics this large or larger fairly often when the true relationship was 0.\nIn sum, the results from Model 1 provide little support for any of the expectations described by H1"
