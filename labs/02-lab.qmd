# Overview {.unnumbered}

Our goal for today is to first reproduce this figure:

```{r}
#| label: goal
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/images/02_fig.png")
```

And then adapt and improve this figure (or other figures) to explore questions we have about the data

I don't expect anyone to be able to recite from memory the exact code, functions, and syntax to accomplish this task.

That said, you've already seen the code you need.

It's available to you in multiple places like the [slides](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/01-slides#/commented-code) and the comments to last week's [labs](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html)

My hope is that this lab will help you do the following:

-   **Chunk big tasks into smaller concrete steps**
    - *How do I produce a figure that shows the average rate of new cases pe month for states with a particular type of face mask policy?* 
      - Well first, I'll need to load some packages to work with and visualize data. 
      - Then, I'll need to get the data. And then...
-   **Think and write programmatically**
    -   In this .qmd file, I'll first ask you to outline, conceptually, all the steps you'll need to do to produce this figure.
    -   Don't worry if you can't think of all the necessary steps or aren't sure of the order. We'll be working through this collectively
    -   When we do code, I'll ask you to organize your code as outlined below:
        -   Separate your steps into sections using the `#` headers in Markdown
        -   Write a brief overview in words that a normal human can understand, what the code in that section is doing
        -   Paste the code for that section into a code chunk
        -   Add brief comments to this code to help your reader understand what's happening
        -   Render your document after completing each section.
-   **Mapping concepts to code**
    -   You shouldn't have to write much new code. Just copy and paste from the labs and slides.
    -   Your goal for today is to interpret that code and develop a mental map that allows you to say when I want to do this type of task (say "recode data"), I need to use some combination of these functions (`%>%`, `mutate()`, maybe `group_by()` or `case_when()`)
-   **Practice wrangling data**
    -   How do you load data?
    -   How do you look at data?
    -   How do you transform data?
-   **Practice visualizing data**
    -   Using the grammar of graphics to translate raw data into visual graphics
    -   Understanding the components of this grammar:
        -   data
        -   aesthetics
        -   geometries
        -   facets
        -   statistics
        -   coordinates
        -   themes
    -   Exploring what happens when we change these components

We'll work in pairs and periodically check in as a class to check our progress, review concepts, and share insights.


If we finish early, you're free to go. If you want, we can take some time to [explore some additional figures](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html){target="_blank"} we might produce like [maps](https://jtr13.github.io/cc19/different-ways-of-plotting-u-s-map-in-r.html){target="_blank"} or [lollipop](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/lollipop-plot.html){target="_blank"} plots.

Ok, let's begin!

# Please render this .qmd file to produce a .html file{.unnumbered}

For every lab:

-   Download the file
-   Save it in your course folder
-   Render the document
-   Open the html file in your browser (Easier to read)
-   Check `Render on Save` and render the document again after completing a section or chunk (Error checking)
-   Upload the final lab to [Canvas](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1094972/assignments){target="_blank"}.

# Describe the components of the figure you're trying to reprodce

Recall, that we need `data`, `aesthetic` mappings and `geometries` to produce a figure. You can find the code from lab 1 [here](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments#uncomment-the-code-below-to-visualize-this-cases_by_month_and_policy)

-   What is the data set used? (Hint it's a transformation of `covid_us`)
-   What are the aesthetic mappings in this plot
-   What is the geometry?

# Outline and implement the steps you will need to complete this process {.unnumbered}

# Step 1

Describe in words what your code below is doing

```{r}
# Write the code for Step 1 here
```

# Step 2

Perhaps Step 2 has multiple parts and code chunks

Use sub headers to break down step 2 into its constituent parts

## Step 2.1

Describe briefly (in a sentence or two or a couple of bullet points) what this section does

```{r}
# Write the code for Step 2.1 here
```

## Step 2.2

Describe briefly (in a sentence or two or a couple of bullet points) what this section does

```{r}
# Write the code for Step 2.2 here
```

# Revise the figure in some way

- Perhaps add a title and label. Or change the aesthetic mappings. Or maybe facet the figure by some other variable.

- Check out the examples from [Tuesday's slides](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/slides/02-slides#/dataviz-describing-distributions-and-associations)

# CLASS SURVEY

Finally, please take a moment to complete this week's [class survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9WCkw7pc2OlDLi6)
