## Mapping Concepts to Code

- Takes time and practice

- Don't be afraid to [FAAFO]{.blue}

- Don't worry about memorizing everything.

- Statistical programming is necessary to actually [do]{.blue} empirical research

- [Learning to code]{.blue} will help us [understand statistical concepts]{.blue}.

- Learning to [think programmatically]{.blue} and algorithmically will help us [tackle complex problems]{.blue}

# {{< fa magnifying-glass >}} Descriptive Statiscs{.inverse}

## Descriptive statistics {.smaller}

- Descriptive statistics help us describe what's typical of our data

- [What's a typical value in our data]{.blue}

  - [Mean](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#mean)
  - [Median](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/01-lab-comments.html#median)

- Descriptive statistics are:

  - Diagnostic
  - Generative

# {{< fa magnifying-glass>}} Levels of understanding{.inverse}

## Levels of understanding in POLS 1600

- Conceptual

- Practical

- Definitional

- Theoretical

. . .

Let's illustrate these different levels of understanding about our old friend the [mean]{.blue}

## Mean: Conceptual Understanding{.smaller}

A mean is:

- A common and important [measure of central tendency]{.blue} (what's typical)

- It's the [arithmetic average]{.blue} you learned in school

- We can think of it as the [balancing point]{.blue} of a distribution

- A [conditional mean]{.blue} is the average of one variable $X$, when some other variable, $Z$ takes a value $z$

  - Think about the average height in our class ([unconditional mean]{.blue}) vs the average height among men and women (\[conditional means\].{blue})

## Mean as a balancing point{.smaller}

![](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra1/StatisticsData/balancepoint1.jpg)

[Source](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra1/StatisticsData/STCenter.html)

## Mean: Practical{.smaller}

There are lots of ways to calculate means in `R`

- The simplest is to use the `mean()` function

  - If our data have missing values, we need to to tell `R` to remove them

```{r}
#| label: meanex
#| eval: false
mean(df$x, na.rm=T)
```

## Conditional Means: Practical{.smaller}

- To calculate a conditional mean we could us a logical index `[df$z == 1]`

```{r}
#| label: conmean
#| eval: false
mean(df$x[df$z == 1], na.rm=T)
```

- If we wanted to a calculate a lot of conditional means we could use the `mean()` in combination with `group_by()` and `summarise()`

```{r}
#| label: grpmean
#| eval: false
df %>% 
  group_by(z)%>%
  summarise(
    x = mean(x, na.rm=T)
  )
```

## Mean: Definitional{.smaller}

Formally, we define the arithmetic mean of $x$ as $\bar{x}$:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\right ) = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n}{n}
$$

In words, this formula says, to calculate the average of x, we sum up all the values of $x_i$ from observation $i=1$ to $i=n$ and then divide by the total number of observations $n$

## Mean: Definitional {.smaller}

- In this class, I don't put a lot of weight on memorizing definitions (that's what Google's for).

- But being comfortable with "the math" is important and useful

- Definitional knowledge is a prerequisite for understanding more theoretical claims.

## Mean: Theoretical{.smaller}

Suppose I asked you to show that the sum of deviations from a mean equals 0?

$$
\text{Claim:} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -\bar{x}) = 0
$$

## Mean: Theoretical {.smaller}

Knowing the definition of an arithmetic mean, we could write:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -\bar{x}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n\bar{x} & \text{Distribute Summation}\\
              &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\bar{x} & \text{Summing a constant, } \bar{x}\\
              &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\times \left ( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\right ) & \text{Definition of } \bar{x}\\
              &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i} & n \times \frac{1}{n}=1\\
              &= 0             
\end{aligned}
$$

## Mean: Theoretical {.smaller}

Why do we care?

- Showing the deviations sum to 0 is another way of saying the mean is a [balancing point]{.blue}.

- This turns out to be a useful property of means that will reappear throughout the course

- If I asked you to make a prediction, $\hat{x}$ of a random person's height in this class, the mean would have the lowest [mean squared error]{.blue} (MSE $=\frac{1}{n}\sum (x_i - \hat{x_i})^2)$

## Mean: Theoretical

Occasionally, you'll read or here me say say things like:

> The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean

In a statistics class, we would take time to prove this.

## The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean{.smaller}

Claim:

Let $x_1, x_2, \dots x_n$ from a random sample from a population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$

Then:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\right )
$$

is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$

$$
E[\bar{x}] = \mu
$$

## The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean {.smaller}

Proof:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E\left [\bar{x} \right] &= E\left [\frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) \right] & \text{Definition of } \bar{x} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^nE\left [ x_i \right]  & \text{Linearity of Expectations} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mu  & E[x_i] = \mu \\
&= \frac{n}{n}  \mu  & \sum_{i=1}^n \mu = n\mu \\
&= \mu  & \blacksquare \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Levels of understanding {.smaller}

::: nonincremental
In this course, we tend to emphasize the

- **Conceptual**

- **Practical**

Over

- Definitional

- Theoretical

In an intro statistics class, the ordering might be reversed.

Trade offs:
:::

- Pro: We actually get to *work with data* and *do empirical research* much sooner
- Cons: We substitute intuitive understandings for more rigorous proofs

- Data visualization is an iterative process

- Good data viz requires lots of data transformations

- Start with a minimum working example and build from there

- Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough.


# {{< fa code >}} Setup

## New packages

This week's lab we'll be using the `dataverse` package to download data on presidential elections

Next week's lab, we'll be using the `tidycensus` package to download census data. 

We'll also need to [install a census API]{.blue} to get the data.

Here's a [detailed guide](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/resources/04-packages) of what we'll do in class right now.

## Install new packages

These packages are easier to install live:

```{r}
#| label: installpacks
#| eval: false
install.packages("dataverse")
install.packages("tidycensus")
install.packages("easystats")
install.packages("DeclareDesign")

```

## Census API {.smaller}

Please follow these steps so you can download data directly from the U.S. Census [here](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/resources/04-packages.html#3_Install_a_Census_API_tidycensus_package):

1.  Install the `tidycensus` package
2.  Load the installed package
3.  Request an API key from the Census
4.  Check your email
5.  Activate your key
6.  Install your API key in R
7.  Check that everything worked

## Preview of the Lab{.smaller}

[Please download]{.blue} Thursday's lab [here](https://pols1600.paultesta.org/labs/05-lab.qmd)

- Conceptually, this lab is designed to help reinforce the relationship between linear models like $y=\beta_0 + \beta_1x$ and the conditional expectation function $E[Y|X]$.

- Substantively, we will explore whether David Leonhardt's claims about [Red Covid](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/briefing/covid-red-states-vaccinations.html) the political polarization of vaccines and its consequences

## Lab: Questions 1-5: Review{.smaller}

Questions 1-5 are designed to [reinforce]{.blue} your [data wrangling]{.blue} skills.  In particular, you will get practice:

  - Creating and recoding variables using `mutate()`
  - Calculating a [moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) or rolling mean using the `rollmean()` function from the `zoo` package
  - Transforming the data on presidential elections so that it can be merged with the data on Covid-19 using the `pivot_wider()` function.
  - [Merging data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) together using the `left_join()` function.



## Lab: Questions 6-10: Simple Linear Regression{.smaller}

- In question 6, you will see how calculating conditional means provides a simple test of "Red Covid" claim.

- In question 7, you will see how a linear model returns the same information as these conditional means (in a sligthly different format)

- In question 8, you will get practice interpreting linear models with continuous predictors (i.e. predictors that take on a range of values)

- In question 9, you will get practice visualizing these models and using the figures help interpret your results substantively.

- Question 10 asks you to play the role of a skeptic and consider what other factors might explain the relationships we found in Questions 6-9. We will explore these factors in next week's lab.

## Before Thursday

The following slides provide detailed explanations of all the code you'll need for each question. 

- [Please run this code before class on Thursday]{.blue}

- We will review this material together at the start of class, but you will spend most of our time on the Questions 6-10

## Q1: Setup your workspace

## Q2.2 Load Election Data {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset

## Task

Q2.2. asks you to write code that will download data presidential elections from 1976 to 2020 from the MIT Election Lab's dataverse

- Once you've installed the `dataverse` package you should be able to do this:

## Code for Q2.2
```{r}
#| label: pres_data
# Try this code first
Sys.setenv("DATAVERSE_SERVER" = "dataverse.harvard.edu")

pres_df <- dataverse::get_dataframe_by_name(
  "1976-2020-president.tab",
  "doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX"
)

# If the code above fails, comment out and uncomment the code below:

# load(url("https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/pres_df.rda"))

## Q3 Describe the structure of each dataset{.smaller}

Question 3 asks you to [describe the structure]{.blue} of each dataset.

- Specifically, it asks you to get a high level overview of `covid` and `pres_df` and describe the [unit of analysis]{.blue} in each dataset:
  - Describe substantively what specific, observation each [row]{.blue} in the dataset corresponds to
  - In covid `covid` dataset, the [unit of analysis]{.blue} is a [state-date]{.blue}

## Q3 Describe the structure of each dataset{.smaller}

Here's some possible code you could use to get a quick [HLO]{.blue} of each dataset:

::: panel-tabset


## HLO `covid`
```{r}
#| label: hlocovid
#| eval: false

# check names in `covid`
names(covid)

# take a quick look values of each variable

glimpse(covid)

# Look at first few observations for:
# date, administrative_area_level_2, 

covid %>% 
  select(date, administrative_area_level_2) %>%
  head()

# Summarize data to get a better sense of the unit of observastion

covid %>% 
  group_by(administrative_area_level_2) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(), # Number of observations for each state
    start_date = min(date, na.rm = T),
    end_date = max(date, na.rm=T)
  ) -> hlo_covid_df

hlo_covid_df


# How many unique values of date and state are their:

n_dates <- length(unique(covid$date))
n_states <- length(unique(covid$administrative_area_level_2))
n_dates
n_states

# If we had observations for every state on every date then the number of rows 
# in the data 
dim(covid)[1]
# Should equal
dim(covid)[1] == n_dates * n_states

# This is what economists would call an unbalanced panel


```

## HLO `pres_df`

```{r}
#| label: hlopresdf
#| eval: false

# check names in `pres_df`
names(pres_df)

# take a quick look values of each variable

glimpse(pres_df)

# Unit of analysis is a year-state-candidate
pres_df %>% 
  select(year, state_po, candidate) %>%
  head()

# How many states?
length(unique(pres_df$state_po))



# How many candidates and parties on the ballot in a given election year
pres_df %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    n_candidates = length(unique(candidate)),
    # Look at both party_detailed and party_simplified
    n_parties_detailed = length(unique(party_detailed)),
    n_parties_simplified = length(unique(party_simplified))
  ) -> hlo_pres_df
hlo_pres_df

# Look at 2020
# pres_df$candidate[pres_df$year == "2020"]

## Q4.2 Calculate Rolling Means of Covid Deaths{.smaller}

::: panel-tabset

## Task

Q4.2 asks you to create new measures of the 7-day and 14-day averages of new deaths from Covid-19 per 100,000 residents

It encourages you to use the code `new_cases_pc_7da` as a template

To build your coding skills, try writing this yourself, then comparing it to the code in the next tab:

## Code for Q4.2
```{r}
covid_us %>%
  dplyr::group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(
    new_deaths = deaths - lag(deaths),
    new_deaths_pc = new_deaths / population *100000,

## Q4.3 Recode Presidential data{.smaller}

## Task

Q4.3 Gives you a long list of steps to recode, reshape, and filter `pres_df` to produce `pres_df2020`

Most of this is review but it can seem like a lot.

Walk through the provided code and see if you can [map each conceptual step]{.blue} in Q4.3 to its [implementation in the code]{.blue}

## Code for Q4.3

## Q5 merging data{.smaller}

## Task

Q5 asks you to merge the 2020 election data from `pres2020_df` into `covid_us` using the common `state` variable in each dataset using the function `left_join()`


## Merge election data into Covid data

```{r}
#| label: merge_pres
dim(covid_us)
dim(pres2020_df)
covid_us <- covid_us %>% left_join(
  pres2020_df,
  by = c("state" = "state")
)
dim(covid_us) 
```
:::

## Advice for merging {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset

## Advice

When merging datasets:

- Check the matches in your joining variables
  - Make sure the values `state` are the same in each dataset 
  - Check for differences in spelling, punctuation, etc.
- Check the [dimensions]{.blue} of output of your `left_join()`
  - If there is a 1-1 match the number of rows should be the same before after

## Illustration

```{r}
#| label: merge_check
# Should be 51 states and DC in each
sum(unique(pres_df$state) %in% covid_us$state)

# Look at each state variable
## With [] index
pres_df$state[1:5]
covid_us$state[1:5]

# Matching is case sensitive 

# make pres_df$state title case

## Base R:
pres_df$state <- str_to_title(pres_df$state )
## Tidy R:
pres_df %>% 
  mutate(
    state = str_to_title(state )
  ) -> pres_df

# Should be 51
sum(unique(pres_df$state) %in% covid_us$state)

# Find the mismatch:
unique(pres_df$state[!pres_df$state %in% covid_us$state])

# Two equivalent ways to fix this mismatch
## Base R: Quick fix to change spelling of DC
pres_df$state[pres2020_df$state == "District Of Columbia"] <- "District of Columbia"

## Tidy R: Quick fix to change spelling of DC

pres_df %>% 
  mutate(
    state = ifelse(test = state == "District Of Columbia",
                   yes = "District of Columbia",
                   no = state
                   )
  ) -> pres_df


# Problem Solved

# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Causal Inference {.inverse}

## Causal inference is about counterfactual comparisons

- Causal inference is about counterfactual comparisons

  - What would have happened if some aspect of the world either had or had not been present

## Causal Identification{.smaller}

- [Casual Identification]{.blue} refers to "the assumptions needed for statistical estimates to be given a causal interpretation" [Keele (2015)](http://lukekeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/causal.pdf)\]

  - What do we need to assume to make our claims about cause and effect credible

- [Experimental Designs]{.blue} rely on [randomization]{.blue} of treatment to justify their causal claims

- [Observational Designs]{.blue} require [additional assumptions]{.blue} and [knowledge]{.blue} to make causal claims 

## Experimental Designs {.smaller}

- [Experimental designs]{.blue} are studies in which a causal variable of interest, the *treatement*, is [manipulated by the researcher]{.blue} to examine its causal effects on some *outcome* of interest

- [Random assignment]{.blue} is the key to causal identification in experiments because it creates [statistical independence]{.blue} between [treatment]{.blue} and [potential outcomes]{.blue} any potential [confounding factors]{.blue}

:::

## Randomization creates credible counterfactual comparisons{.smaller}

If treatment has been randomly assigned, then:

- The only thing that differs between treatment and control is that one group got the treatment, and another did not.
- We can estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) using the difference of sample means

:::{.fragment}

$$
\begin{aligned}
E \left[ \frac{\sum_1^m Y_i}{m}-\frac{\sum_{m+1}^N Y_i}{N-m}\right]&=\overbrace{E \left[ \frac{\sum_1^m Y_i}{m}\right]}^{\substack{\text{Average outcome}\\
\text{among treated}\\ \text{units}}}
-\overbrace{E \left[\frac{\sum_{m+1}^N Y_i}{N-m}\right]}^{\substack{\text{Average outcome}\\
\text{among control}\\ \text{units}}}\\
&= E [Y_i(1)|D_i=1] -E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]
\end{aligned}
$$

:::

## Observational Designs {.smaller}

- [Observational designs]{.blue} are studies in which a causal variable of interest is determined by someone/thing [other than the researcher]{.blue} (nature, governments, people, etc.)

- Since treatment has not been randomly assigned, observational studies typically require [stronger assumptions]{.blue} to make causal claims.

- Generally speaking, these assumptions amount to a claim about conditional independence

:::{.fragment}


$$
Y_i(1),Y_i(0),\mathbf{X_i},\mathbf{U_i} \unicode{x2AEB} D_i | K_i
$$

:::

- Where after conditioning on $K_i$, some [knowledge about the world]{.blue} and how the [data were generated]{.blue}, our [treatment]{.blue} is as good as (as-if) randomly assigned (hence [conditionally independent]{.blue})
  - Economists often call this assumption of [selection on observables]{.blue}

## Causal Inference in Observational Studies {.smaller}

To understand how to make causal claims in observational studies we will:

- Introduce the concept of [Directed Acyclic Graphs]{.blue} to describe causal relationships

- Discuss three approaches to [covariate adjustment]{.blue}

  - Subclassification
  - Matching
  - [Linear Regression]{.blue}

- Three research designs for observational data

  - [Differences-in-Differences]{.blue}
  - Regression Discontinuity Designs
  - Instrumental Variables
  
  


# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Directed Acyclic Graphs {.inverse}


## Two Ways to Describe Causal Claims

In this course, we will use two forms of notation to describe our causal claims.

- *Potential Outcomes Notation* (last lecture)

  - Illustrates the [fundamental problem of causal inference]{.blue}

- [**Directed Acyclic Graphs** (DAGs)]{.blue}

  - Illustrates potential bias from [confounders]{.blue} and [colliders]{.blue}

## Directed Acyclic Graphs

- Directed Acyclic Graphs provide a way of encoding assumptions about casual relationships

  - **Directed** Arrows $\to$ describe a direct causal effect

  - Arrow from $D\to Y$ means $Y_i(d) \neq Y_i(d^\prime)$ "The outcome ( $Y$) for person $i$ when D happens ( $Y_i(d)$ ) is different than the the outcome when $D$ doesn't happen ( $Y_i(d^\prime)$ )

  - No arrow = no effect ( $Y_i(d) = Y_i(d^\prime)$ )

  - **Acyclic:** No cycles. A variable can't cause itself

## Variables

:::{.nonincremental}

Causal Explanations Involve:

- `Y` our outcome
- `D` A possible cause of Y
- `M` A [mediator]{.blue} or mechanism through which `D` effects `Y`
- `Z` An [instrument]{.blue} that can help us isolate the effects of D on  `Y
- `X2` a [covariate]{.blue} that may [moderate]{.blue} the effect of `D` on `Y`

Threats to causal claims/Sources of bias:

- `X1` an [observed confounder]{.blue} that is a common cause of both `D` & `Y` 
- `U` an [unobserved confounder]{.blue} a common cause of both `D` & `Y` 
- `K` a [collider]{.blue} that is a common consequence of both `D` & `Y`

## DAGs illustrate two sources of bias:

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Confounder bias:** Failing to control for a common cause of `D` **and** `Y` (aka Omitted Variable Bias)

- **Collider bias:** Controlling for a common consequence (aka Selection Bias^[Note in practice there's some slippage/debate/disagreement around this nomenclature])

# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Covariate Adjustment {.inverse}

##  Covariate Adjustment

Covariate adjustment refers a broad class of procedures that try to make a comparison more credible or meaningful by adjusting for some other potentially confounding factor.


##  Covariate Adjustment

When you hear people talk about

- Controlling for age
- Conditional on income
- Holding age and income constant
- Ceteris paribus (All else equal)

They are typically talking about some sort of covariate adjustment.


##  Three approaches to covariate adjustment{.smallero}

- [Subclassification]{.blue}
  - 👍: Easy to implement and interpret
  - 👎: Curse of dimensionality, Selection on observables

- [Matching ]{.blue}
  - 👍: Balance on multiple covariates, Mirrors logic of experimental design 
  - 👎: Selection on observables, Only provides balance on observed variables, Lot's of technical details...

- [Regression]{.blue}
  - 👍: Easy to implement, control for many factors (good and bad)
  - 👎: Selection on observables, easy to fit "bad" models

- **Conceptual**
  - Simple linear regression estimates "a line of best fit" that summarizes relationships between two variables

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

- **Practical**

## Understanding Linear Regression{.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- *Technical/Definitional*
  - Linear regression chooses $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR):

$$\textrm{Find }\hat{\beta_0},\,\hat{\beta_1} \text{ arg min}_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum (y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i))^2$$

- *Theoretical*
  - Linear regression provides a **linear** estimate of the conditional expectation function (CEF): $E[Y|X]$

:::


# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Conceptual: Linear Regression {.inverse}

## Conceptual: Linear Regression

- Regression is a tool for describing relationships.

  - How does some outcome we're interested in tend to change as some predictor of that outcome changes?

  - How does economic development vary with democracy?
    
    - Or how does democracy vary with economic development...

  - How does economic development vary with democracy, adjusting for natural resources like oil and gas


## Conceptual: Linear Regression {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

More formally:

$$
y_i = f(x_i) + \epsilon
$$

- Y is a function of X plus some error, $\epsilon$

- Linear regression assumes that relationship between an outcome and a predictor can be described by a [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity) function

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon
$$
:::

## Linear Regression and the Line of Best Fit {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}


- The goal of linear regression is to choose coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to summarizes the relationship between $y$ and $x$

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon
$$

- To accomplish this we need some sort of criteria.

- For linear regression, that criteria is minimizing the error between what our model predicts $\hat{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ and what we actually observed $(y_i)$

- More on this to come. But first...

:::

## Regression Notation{.smaller}

- $y_i$ an **outcome variable** or thing we're trying to explain

  - AKA: The dependent variable, The response variable, The left hand side of the model

- $x_i$ a **predictor variables** or things we think explain variation in our outcome

  - AKA: The independent variable, covariates, the right hand side of the model.

  - Cap or No Cap: I'll use $X$ (should be $\mathbf{X}$) to denote a set (matrix) of predictor variables. $y$ vs $Y$ can also have technical distinctions (Sample vs Population, observed value vs Random Variable, ...)

- $\beta$ a set of **unknown parameters** that describe the relationship between our outcome $y_i$ and our predictors $x_i$

- $\epsilon_i$ the **error term** representing variation in $y_i$ not explained by our model.

- $\hat{\epsilon_i}$  is a residual, or an estimate of the error, given a model.

## Linear Regression {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- We call this a bivariate regression, because there are only two variables

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

- We call this a linear regression, because $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ is the equation for a line, where:

  - $\beta_0$ corresponds to the $y$ intercept, or the model's prediction when $x = 0$.

  - $\beta_1$ corresponds to the slope, or how $y$ is predicted to change as $x$ changes.
:::

## Linear Regression {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- If you find this notation confusing, try plugging in substantive concepts for what $y$ and $x$ represent
- Say we wanted to know how attitudes to transgender people varied with age in the baseline survey from Lab 03.

The generic linear model

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$

Reflects:

$$\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Age}_i + \epsilon_i$$

# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Practical: Estimating a Linear Regression {.inverse}

## Practical: Estimating a Linear Regression{.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- We estimate linear regressions in `R` using the `lm()` function.
- `lm()` requires two arguments:
  - a `formula` argument of the general form `y ~ x` read as "Y modeled by X" or below "Transgender Feeling Thermometer (`y`) modeled by (`~`) Age (`x`)
  - a `data` argument telling R where to find the variables in the formula

```{r}
#| label: lmdata
load(url("https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/03_lab.rda"))
m1 <- lm(therm_trans_t0 ~ vf_age, data = df)
m1

```

:::

## The `lm()` function{.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

The coefficients from `lm()` are saved in object called `m1`

```{r}
#| label: printm1
m1
```

`m1` actually contains a lot of information

```{r}
#| label: m1info
names(m1)
m1$coefficients
```

:::

## Practical: Interpreting a Linear Regression{.smaller}

We can extract the intercept and slope from this simple bivariate model, using the `coef()` function

```{r}
#| label: m1coef

# All the coefficients
coef(m1)
# Just the intercept
coef(m1)[1]
# Just the slope
coef(m1)[2]
```

## Practical: Interpreting a Linear Regression{.smaller}

The two coefficients from `m1` define a line of best fit, summarizing how feelings toward transgender individuals change with age

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$

$$\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Age}_i + \epsilon_i$$

$$\text{Transgender Feeling Thermometer}_i = `r round(coef(m1)[1],2)` + `r round(coef(m1)[2],2)` \text{Age}_i + \epsilon_i$$

## Practical: Predicted values from a Linear Regression{.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- Often it's useful for interpretation to obtain [predicted values]{.blue} from a regression.

- To obtain predicted vales $(\hat{y})$, we simply plug in a value for $x$ (In this case, $Age$) and evaluate our equation.

- For example, might we expect attitudes to differ among an 18-year-old college student and their 68-year-old grandparent?

$$\hat{FT}_{x=18} = `r round(coef(m1)[1],2)` + `r round(coef(m1)[2],2)` \times 18  = 59.16$$ $$\hat{FT}_{x=65} = `r round(coef(m1)[1],2)` + `r round(coef(m1)[2],2)` \times 68  = 49.01$$
:::

## Practical: Predicted values from a Linear Regression

We could do this by hand

```{r}
#| label: pred_man
coef(m1)[1] + coef(m1)[2] * 18
coef(m1)[1] + coef(m1)[2] * 68

```

## Practical: Predicted values from a Linear Regression{.smaller}

More often we will:

- Make a [prediction data frame]{.blue} (called `pred_df` below) with the values of interests
- Use the `predict()` function with our linear model (`m1`) and `pred_df`
- Save the predicted values to our new column in our prediction data frame

## Practical: Predicted values from a Linear Regression

```{r}
#| label: pred_df

# Make prediction data frame
pred_df <- data.frame(
  vf_age = c(18, 68)
)
# Predict FT for 18 and 68 year-olds
predict(m1, newdata = pred_df)

# Save predictions to data frame
pred_df$ft_trans_hat <- predict(m1, newdata = pred_df)
pred_df
```

# {{< fa lightbulb >}} Technichal: Mechanics of Linear Regression {background-color="lightgrey"}

## How did `lm()` choose $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1${.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- P: By minimizing the sum of squared errors, in procedure called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression



- Q: Ok, that's not really that helpful...

  - What's an error?
  - Why would we square and sum them
  - How do we minimize them.

P: Good questions!

:::

## What's an error? What's a residual{.smaller}

Recall an error, $\epsilon_i$, is the deviation of from an unknown true model

$$
y_i = f(x_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

A residual, $\hat{\epsilon_i}$ is an estimate of the error obtained by taking the difference between the observed value of $y_i$ and what our model would predict, $\hat{y_i}$ given some value of $x_i$. So for a model:

$$y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i$$

We simply subtract our model's prediction $\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i}$ from the observed value, $y_i$

$$\hat{\epsilon_i}=y_i-\hat{y_i}=(Y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i}))$$
 

## Why are we squaring and summing $\epsilon${.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

There are more mathy reasons for this, but at intuitive level, the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)

- Squaring $\epsilon$ treats positive and negative residuals equally.

- Summing produces single value summarizing our models overall performance.

There are other criteria we could use (e.g. minimizing the sum of absolute errors), but SSR has some nice properties
:::

## How do we minimize $\sum \epsilon^2$ {.smaller}

OLS chooses $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to minimize $\sum \epsilon^2$, the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)

$$\textrm{Find }\hat{\beta_0},\,\hat{\beta_1} \text{ arg min}_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum (y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i))^2$$

## How did `lm()` choose $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ {.smaller}

In an intro stats course, we would walk through the process of finding

$$\textrm{Find }\hat{\beta_0},\,\hat{\beta_1} \text{ arg min}_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum (y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i))^2$$ Which involves a little bit of calculus. The big payoff is that

$$\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x}$$ And

$$ \beta_1 = \frac{Cov(x,y)}{Var(x)}$$ Which is never quite the epiphany, I think we think it is...

The following slides walk you through the mechanics of this exercise. We're gonna skip through them in class, but they're there for your reference

## How do we minimize $\sum \epsilon^2${.smaller}

To understand what's going on under the hood, you need a broad understanding of some basic calculus.

The next few slides provide a brief review of derivatives and differential calculus.

## Derivatives{.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

The derivative of $f$ at $x$ is its rate of change at $x$

- For a line: the slope
- For a curve: the slope of a line tangent to the curve

You'll see two notations for derivatives:

1.  Leibniz notation:

$$
\frac{df}{dx}(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}
$$

2.  Lagrange: $f^{\prime}(x)$

:::


## Some useful facts about derivatives{.smaller}

Derivative of a constant

$$
f^{\prime}(c)=0
$$

Derivative of a line f(x)=2x

$$
f^{\prime}(2x)=2
$$

Derivative of $f(x)=x^2$

$$
f^{\prime}(x^2)=2x
$$

Chain rule: y= f(g(x)). The derivative of y with respect to x is

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)))=f^{\prime}(g(x))g^{\prime}(x)
$$

The derivative of the "outside" times the derivative of the "inside," remembering that the derivative of the outside function is evaluated at the value of the inside function.

## Finding a local Minimum{.smaller}

Local minimum:

$$
f^{\prime}(x)=0 \text{ and } f^{\prime\prime}(x)>0 
$$

## Minimizing the sum of squared errors{.smaller}

Our model

$$y_i =\beta_0+\beta_1x_{i}+\epsilon_i$$

Finds coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to to minimize the sum of squared residuals, $\hat{\epsilon}_i$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2 &= \sum (y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})^2
\end{aligned}$$

## Minimizing the sum of squared errors{.smaller}

We solve for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, by taking the partial derivatives with respect to $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, and setting them equal to zero

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2}{\partial \beta_0} &= -2\sum (y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})=0 & f'(-x^2) = -2x\\
\frac{\partial \sum \hat{\epsilon_i}^2}{\partial\beta_1} &= -2\sum (y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})x_{i}=0 & \text{chain rule}
\end{aligned}$$

## Solving for $\beta_0${.smaller}

First, we'll solve for $\beta_0$, by multiplying both sides by -1/2 and distributing the $\sum$:

$$\begin{aligned}
0 &= -2\sum (y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})\\
\sum \beta_0 &= \sum y_i - \sum \beta_1 x_{i}\\
N \beta_0 &= \sum y_i -\sum \beta_1 x_{i}\\
\beta_0 &= \frac{\sum y_i}{N} - \frac{\beta_1 \sum x_{i}}{N}\\
\beta_0 &= \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x}
\end{aligned}$$

## Solving for $\beta_1${.smaller}

Now, we can solve for $\beta_1$ plugging in $\beta_0$.

$$\begin{aligned}
0 &= -2\sum [(y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1 x_{i})x_{i}]\\
0 &= \sum [y_ix_i-(\bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x})x_{i}-\beta_1 x_{i}^2]\\
0 &= \sum [y_ix_i-\bar{y}x_{i} + \beta_1 \bar{x}x_{i}-\beta_1 x_{i}^2]
\end{aligned}$$

## Solving for $\beta_1${.smaller}

Now we'll rearrange some terms and pull out an $x_{i}$ to get

$$\begin{aligned}
0 &= \sum [(y_i -\bar{y} + \beta_1 \bar{x}-\beta_1 x_{i})x_{i}]
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing both sides by $x_{i}$ and distributing the summation, we can isolate $\beta_1$

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1 \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x}) &= \sum (y_i -\bar{y})
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing by $\sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})$ to get

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1  &= \frac{\sum (y_i -\bar{y})}{\sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})}
\end{aligned}$$

## Solving for $\beta_1${.smaller}

Finally, by multiplying by $\frac{(x_{i}-\bar{x})}{(x_{i}-\bar{x})}$ we get

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1  &= \frac{\sum (y_i -\bar{y})(x_{i}-\bar{x})}{\sum (\bar{x}-x_{i})^2}
\end{aligned}$$

Which has a nice interpretation:

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1 &= \frac{Cov(x,y)}{Var(x)}
\end{aligned}$$

So the coefficient in a simple linear regression of $Y$ on $X$ is simply the ratio of the covariance between $X$ and $Y$ over the variance of $X$. Neat!

## The Conditional Expectation Function{.smaller}

Of all the functions we could choose to describe the relationship between $Y$ and $X$,

$$
Y_i = f(X_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$ $(E[Y|X])$, has some appealing properties

$$
Y_i = E[Y_i|X_i] + \epsilon
$$

The error, by definition, is uncorrelated with X and $E[\epsilon|X]=0$

$$
E[\epsilon|X] = E[Y - E[Y|X]|X]= E[Y|X] - E[Y|X] = 0
$$

Of all the possible functions $g(X)$, we can show that $E[Y_i|X_i]$ is the best predictor in terms of minimizing **mean squared error**

$$
E[ (Y - g(Y))^2] \geq E[(Y - E[Y|X])^2] 
$$

## What you need to know about Regression {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- **Conceptual**
  - Simple linear regression estimates a line of best fit that summarizes relationships between two variables

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

- **Practical**
  - We estimate linear models in R using the `lm()` function

```{r}
#| label: ols
#| eval: false
lm(y ~ x, data = df)
```

## What you need to know about Regression {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- *Technical/Definitional*
  - Linear regression chooses $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR):

$$\textrm{Find }\hat{\beta_0},\,\hat{\beta_1} \text{ arg min}_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum (y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i))^2$$

- *Theoretical*
  - Linear regression provides a **linear** estimate of the conditional expectation function (CEF): $E[Y|X]$

## Motivating Example: What causes Cholera? {.smaller background-image=https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/gallery_item/public/media-images/2020-11/map-lead-4.jpg?h=2ded5a3f&itok=Mn-K5rQc, background-opacity=.3}

- In the 1800s, cholera was thought to be transmitted through the air.

- John Snow (the physician, not the snack), to explore the origins eventunally concluding that cholera was transmitted through living organisms in water.

- Leveraged a **natural experiment** in which one water company in London moved its pipes further upstream (reducing contamination for Lambeth), while other companies kept their pumps serving Southwark and Vauxhall in the same location. 


## Notation {.smaller}

Let's adopt a little notation to help us think about the logic of Snow's design:

- $D$: treatment indicator, 1 for treated neighborhoods (Lambeth), 0 for control neighborhoods (Southwark and Vauxhall)

- $T$: period indicator, 1 if post treatment (1854), 0 if pre-treatment (1849).

- $Y_{di}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ 

  - $Y_{1i}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ when treated between the two periods 

  - $Y_{0i}(t)$ the potential outcome of unit $i$ when control between the two periods 


## Causal Effects {.smaller}

The individual causal effect for unit i at time t is:

$$\tau_{it} = Y_{1i}(t) − Y_{0i}(t)$$

What we observe is 

$$Y_i(t) = Y_{0i}(t)\cdot(1 − D_i(t)) + Y_{1i}(t)\cdot D_i(t)$$

$D$ only equals 1, when $T$ equals 1, so we never observe $Y_0i(1)$ for the treated units. 

In words, we don't know what Lambeth's outcome would have been in the second period, had they not been treated.


## Average Treatment on Treated {.smaller}

Our goal is to estimate the average effect of treatment on treated (ATT):


$$\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{1i}(1) -  Y_{0i}(1)|D=1]$$

That is, what would have happened in Lambeth, had their water company not moved their pipes


## Average Treatment on Treated {.smaller}

Our goal is to estimate the average effect of treatment on treated (ATT):

We we can observe is:

|               | Pre-Period (T=0)  | Post-Period (T=1)  |
|-|--|-|
| Treated $D_{i}=1$  |  $E[Y_{0i}(0)\vert D_i = 1]$ | $E[Y_{1i}(1)\vert D_i = 1]$  |
| Control $D_i=0$  |  $E[Y_{0i}(0)\vert D_i = 0]$ | $E[Y_{0i}(1)\vert D_i = 0]$  |


## Data {.smaller}

Because potential outcomes notation is abstract, let's consider a modified description of the Snow's cholera death data from [Scott Cunningham](https://mixtape.scunning.com/difference-in-differences.html):

```{r}
#| label = "choleradat",
#| echo = F
snow <- tibble(Company = c("Lambeth (D=1)", "Southwark and Vauxhall (D=0)"),
               `1849 (T=0)` = c(85,135),
               `1854 (T=1)` = c(19,147),

               )

knitr::kable(snow)

```


## How can we estimate the effect of moving pumps upstream? {.smaller}

Recall, our goal is to estimate the effect of the the treatment on the treated:

$$\tau_{ATT} = E[Y_{1i}(1) -  Y_{0i}(1)|D=1]$$

Let's conisder some strategies Snow could take to estimate this quantity:


## Before vs after comparisons:{.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}
- Snow could have compared Labmeth in 1854 $(E[Y_i(1)|D_i = 1] = 19)$ to Lambeth in 1849 $(E[Y_i(0)|D_i = 1]=85)$, and claimed that moving the pumps upstream led to **66 fewer cholera deaths.** 

- Assumes Lambeth's pre-treatment outcomes in 1849 are a good proxy for what its outcomes would have been in 1954 if the pumps hadn't moved $(E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1])$.

- A skeptic might argue that Lambeth in 1849 $\neq$ Lambeth in 1854


```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(snow) |> 
  kable_styling() |> 
  row_spec(1, bold=T,color = "blue")
```

:::


## Treatment-Control comparisons in the Post Period. {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

- Snow could have compared outcomes between Lambeth and S&V in 1954  ($E[Yi(1)|Di = 1] − E[Yi(1)|Di = 0]$), concluding that the change in pump locations led to **128 fewer deaths.**

- Here the assumption is that the outcomes in S&V and in 1854 provide a good proxy for what would have happened in Lambeth in 1954 had the pumps not been moved $(E[Y_{0i}(1)|D_i = 1])$

- Again, our skeptic could argue  Lambeth $\neq$ S&V 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(snow) |> 
  kable_styling() |> 
  kableExtra::column_spec(3, bold=T, color="red")
```

:::

## Difference in Differences {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}
To address these concerns, Snow employed what we now call a [difference-in-differences]{.blue} design, 

There are two, equivalent ways to view this design. 

$$\underbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0]\}}_{\text{1. Treat-Control |Post }}− \overbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\text{Treated-Control|Pre}}$$

- Difference 1: Average change between Treated and Control  in Post Period

- Difference 2: Average change between Treated and Control  in Pre Period

:::

## Difference in Differences {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

$$\underbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0]\}}_{\text{1. Treat-Control |Post }}− \overbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\text{Treated-Control|Pre}}$$
Is equivalent to: 

$$\underbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 1] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i} = 1]\}}_{\text{Post - Pre |Treated }}− \overbrace{\{E[Y_{i}(1)|D_{i} = 0] − E[Y_{i}(0)|D_{i}=0 ]}^{\text{Post-Pre|Control}}$$


- Difference 1: Average change between Treated over time
- Difference 2: Average change between Control over time

:::

## Difference in Differences {.smaller}


You'll see the DiD design represented both ways, but they produce the same result:

$$
\tau_{ATT} = (19-147) - (85-135) = -78
$$

$$
\tau_{ATT} = (19-85) - (147-135) = -78
$$


## Identifying Assumption of a Difference in Differences Design {.smaller}

The key assumption in this design is what's known as the parallel trends assumption: $E[Y_{0i}(1) − Y_{0i}(0)|D_i = 1] = E[Y_{0i}(1) − Y_{0i}(0)|D_i = 0]$ 

- In words: If Lambeth hadn't moved its pumps, it would have followed a similar path as S&V

## Concept

- Recall that linear regression provides a...
  - linear estimate of the conditional expectation function
- In the canonincal pre-post, treated and control DiD, $\beta_3$ from the following linear regression will give us the ATT:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Post + \beta_2 Treated + \underbrace{\beta_3Post\times Treated}_{\tau_{ATT}}
$$

## Summary {.smaller}

- A Difference in Differences (DiD, or diff-in-diff) design combines a pre-post comparison, with a treated and control comparison
  
  - Taking the pre-post difference removes any fixed differences between the units
  
  - Then taking the difference between treated and control differences removes any common differences over time

- The key identifying assumption of a DiD design is the "assumption of parallel trends"
  - Absent treatment, treated and control groups
would see the same changes over time.
  - Hard to prove, possible to test



## Extensions and limitations {.smaller}

- Diff-in-Diff easy to estimate with linear regression
- Generalizes to multiple periods and treatment interventions
  - More pre-treatment periods allow you assess "parallel trends" assumption
- Alternative methods 
  - Synthetic control
  - Event Study Designs
- What if you have multiple treatments or treatments that come and go?
  - Panel Matching
  - Generalized Synthetic control
