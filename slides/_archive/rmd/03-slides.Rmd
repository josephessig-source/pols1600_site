## Review

- Set up
- Data wrangling
- Data visualization


---
## Setup

Every time you work in R

- Save your file to your course or project folder

- Set your working directory

- Load, and if needed, install packages

- Maybe change some global options in your .Rmd file

---
## Setting your working directory:

- My default code for setting a working directory is:

```{r}
# Set working directory
wd <- "." # Change to file path on your computer
setwd(wd)
```

- This is really just a reminder to someone else using my code that they need to have their working directories set up correctly

- R Studio sets the working directory automatically, when you knit the file

- When I work on a file, I set the working directory manually



---
## Setting your working directory when working "Live"

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://statisticsglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/figure-2-set-working-directory-to-source-file-location-manually.png")
```




---
## Packages for today


```{r packages, cache=F}
the_packages <- c(
  ## R Markdown
  "kableExtra","DT",
  
  ## Tidyverse
  "tidyverse", "lubridate", "forcats", 
  "haven", "labelled",
  
  ## Extensions for ggplot
  "ggmap","ggrepel", "ggridges", 
  "ggthemes", "ggpubr", "GGally",
  "scales", "dagitty", "ggdag", #<<
  
  # Data 
  "COVID19","maps","mapdata",
  "qss" #<<
)
```

---
## Define a function to load (and if needed install) packages


```{r ipak}
ipak <- function(pkg){
    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
    if (length(new.pkg)) 
        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

```

---
## Load packages for today

```{r}
ipak(the_packages)
```


---

# 💪
## Load the Covid-19 Data

---
## Load the Covid-19 Data

```{r covid}
# covid <- COVID19::covid19(
#   country = "US",
#   level = 2,
#   verbose = F
# )
load(url("https://pols1600.paultesta.org/files/data/covid.rda"))
```


---
## Filter the Covid-19 Data to include Just US States

```{r covidus}
# Vector containing of US territories
territories <- c(
  "American Samoa",
  "Guam",
  "Northern Mariana Islands",
  "Puerto Rico",
  "Virgin Islands"
  )

# Filter out Territories and create state variable
covid_us <- covid %>%
  filter(!administrative_area_level_2 %in% territories)%>%
  mutate(
    state = administrative_area_level_2
  )
```


---
## Setting global options

- Lets you control the default behavior of R and R Markdown
  - Do you want to print warnings when you knit?
  - How big should your figures be
- I'll typically set these for you

---
## The global options for these slides



```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE, 
  message = FALSE, 
  comment = NA, 
  dpi = 300, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%", 
  cache = FALSE) #<<
```

---
## Cacheing

- Sometimes I will turn [cacheing](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cache.html) on (`cache=TRUE`)

- When you knit with cache-ing, R saves the output of each codechunk 

- The next time you knit, if the code in a code chunk hasn't changed, R just loads the saved output from the previous session, rather than re-running the code.

- This is useful when [a chunk of code takes a long time to run](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cache.html)

- This can potentially create errors, if you change something in one code chunk, but subsequent code are unchanged and load older versions of your code, that don't have the thing you changed.

- If this happens, try turning off the cacheing  (`cache=F`) and rerunning your code. If your code works, can turn cache-ing back on.

## Data transformations


You want to:

- Load some data

- Combine multiple functions

- Look at your data

- Recode your data

- Transform your data

# 🔍
# Recoding categorical data in R

Let's clarify what's going on when we create the `face_masks` variable from the `facial_coverings` variable

- Why are we doing this
- What does `mutate()` do
- What does `case_when()` do
- What does `factor()` do

---
## Why are we doing this?

When we looked at the raw data, `facial_coverings` was a numeric variable with both positive and negative values

```{r}
table(covid_us$facial_coverings)
```

---
## Why are we doing this?

Substantively, the absolute value of these numeric values correspond to increasingly restrictive face mask policies:

- 0 - No policy
- 1 - Recommended
- 2 - Required in some specified shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present, or some situations when social distancing not possible
- 3 - Required in all shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present or all situations when social distancing not possible
- 4 - Required outside the home at all times regardless of location or presence of other people

With negative values denoting "best guesses" of the policy in effect for most people in a state
  - Example: Illinois is coded as a negative 4 when Chicago adopts a stringent face mask policy

---
## Why are we doing this?

- The numbers for these policies reflect an *ordinal* ranking:
  - No policy is less restrictive than Recommendations is less restrictive than requirements ...
- Beyond this ordering, the numbers themselves don't convey any additional meaning:
  - A partial requirement (2) is not "twice as restrictive" as a recommendation (1).
- How to treat statewide policies (positive numbers) vs mixed regimes (negative) is tricky
  - Ideally, we'd use more granular data (e.g. counties)
  - In practice, we'll collapse this distinction in our code
  - As social scientists, we'd then want explore how our results change using alternative coding rules
- By converting the numeric `facial_coverings` variable into the categorical, ordered factor `face_masks` we get a variable that:
  - Has meaningful labels
  - Retains the substantive ordering of policies

---
## Creating the `face_masks` variable

Here's the snippet of code I've given you in the past:

```{r}
covid_us %>%
mutate(
    face_masks = case_when(
      facial_coverings == 0 ~ "No policy",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 1 ~ "Recommended",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 2 ~ "Some requirements",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 3 ~ "Required shared places",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 4 ~ "Required all times",
    ) %>% factor(.,
      levels = c("No policy","Recommended",
                 "Some requirements",
                 "Required shared places",
                 "Required all times")
    ) 
    ) -> covid_us
```

---
## Creating the `face_masks` variable

Here's a slightly clearer way of doing the same thing

```{r}
covid_us %>%
mutate(
  # Recode facial_coverings to create face_masks
    face_masks = case_when(
      facial_coverings == 0 ~ "No policy",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 1 ~ "Recommended",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 2 ~ "Some requirements",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 3 ~ "Required shared places",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 4 ~ "Required all times",
    ),
    # Turn face_masks into a factor with ordered policy levels
    face_masks = factor(face_masks,
      levels = c("No policy","Recommended",
                 "Some requirements",
                 "Required shared places",
                 "Required all times")
    ) 
    ) -> covid_us
```

---
## Understanding what `case_when()` does

Let's take a (pseudo) random slice of our data:

```{r, highlight.output=c(4,8,9)}
set.seed(123)
covid_us %>%
  select(date, state, facial_coverings, face_masks)%>%
  slice(sample(1:dim(covid_us)[1], size=10, replace = F))
```

---
## Understanding all that other stuff did

.pull-left[
- `set.seed(123)` sets the "seed" that your computer uses to generate pseudo random numbers
- `select()` selects just the `date`, `state`, `facial_coverings`, and `face_masks` columns from the data
- `slice()` selects a slice of rows from the data
- `sample()` takes random sample from the sequence of numbers 1 to 40,889 (`dim(covid_us)`) of size 10, without replacement (no duplicates), which `slice()` interprets as the rows you want to select

]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = F}
set.seed(123)
covid_us %>%
  select(date, state, facial_coverings, face_masks)%>%
  slice(sample(1:dim(covid_us)[1], size=10, replace = F))
```

]

---
## Data visualization

A basic graphic requires at minimum:

- `data:` the dataset containing the variables of interest.
- `aes`: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset.
- `geom:` the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot For example: points, lines, and bars.

---
## Data visualization

Basic graphics are made even better with:

- `facets`
- `statistics`
- `coordinates`
- `themes`

# Causal Inference
## *Causal claims imply counterfactual comparisons*

---
## Causal claims imply counterfactual comparisons

  
- Causal claims imply claims about counterfactuals
  - What would have happened if we were to change some aspect of the world?

--

What's the counter factual for these claims:  

--

- Foreign aid increases develop

--

- Wikileaks cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election

--

- Democracies don't fight wars with other democracies

--

- Universal Pre-K improves child development

# 💡
# Notations to describe causal claims

---

In this course, we will use two forms of notation to describe our causal claims.

- Directed Acyclic Graphs

- Potential Outcomes Notation

---
## Directed Acyclic Graphs

- Directed Acyclic Graphs provide a way of encoding assumptions about casual relationships

  - **Directed** Arrows $\to$ describe a direct causal effect 

  - Arrow from $D\to Y$ means $Y_i(d) \neq Y_i(d^\prime)$ "The outcome ( $Y$) for person $i$ when D happens ( $Y_i(d)$ ) is different than the the outcome when $D$ doesn't happen ( $Y_i(d^\prime)$ )

  - No arrow = no effect ( $Y_i(d) = Y_i(d^\prime)$ )

  - **Acyclic:** No cycles. A variable can't cause itself

- Used by Pearl ([2009](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html), [2017](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html)) to describe and assess causal structural models


> Basically, they're math's fancy pants version of a flow chart

---
## Why we use Directed Acyclic Graphs

- Directed Acyclic Graphs are flexible ways of representing complex relationships

- They're great for illustrating sources of potential bias in our models:

- Two types of bias we'll talk about today:

  - **Confounder bias:** Bias that exists because two variables have a *common cause*

  - **Collider bias:** Bias we create when we condition on a *common consequence*


---
## What do we mean by bias

We'll talk about lots of types of bias throughout this course.

Formally, we'll say an estimate, $\hat{\theta}$ ("theta hat") is an unbiased estimator of a parameter, $\theta$ ("theta") if:

$$
E[\hat{\theta}] = \theta
$$

Bias or error, $\epsilon$, is the difference between our estimate and the truth

$$
\epsilon = \hat{\theta} -\theta
$$

An estimator is unbiased if, on average, the errors equal 0

$$
E[\epsilon] = E[\hat{\theta} -\theta] = 0
$$

---
## Bias vs. variance

```

---
## The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

```{r,  echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/docs/BiasVariance/biasvariance.png")
```

---
## Drawing DAGs in R

- Let's draw some dags to consider some simple examples:

  - Does drinking coffee cause lung cancer? (Confounding bias)

  - Does chicken pox cause influenza? (Collider bias)

- Nice examples of DAGs from [ggdag](https://ggdag.malco.io/index.html)


---
### Confounding = Common Causes

```{r, echo=F}
confounder_triangle(x = "Coffee", y = "Lung Cancer", z = "Smoking") %>% 
  ggdag_dconnected(text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")+
  theme_void()
  

```

---
### Controlling for a confounding variable

```{r, echo=F}

confounder_triangle(x = "Coffee", y = "Lung Cancer", z = "Smoking") %>% 
  ggdag_drelationship(controlling_for = "z",text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")+
  theme_void()

```

---
### Colliders = Common Consequence

```{r, echo=F}
fever_dag <- collider_triangle(x = "Influenza", 
                  y = "Chicken Pox", 
                  m = "Fever") 

ggdag(fever_dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")+
  theme_void()
```

---
### Don't Condition on a Collider

```{r, echo=F}
ggdag_dseparated(fever_dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")+
  theme_void()
```

---
### Don't Condition on a Collider

```{r, echo=F}
ggdag_dconnected(fever_dag, controlling_for = "m",text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")+
  theme_void()
```

---
## Potential Outcomes

- DAGs are great for representing a wide array of relationships

- Doing [causal inference with DAGs](https://mixtape.scunning.com/dag.html) is a bit beyond the scope of this class

- Instead, we'll typically talk about causal claims using the logic of potential outcomes to describe the counterfactual comparisons we want to make.

- To do this, we'll need to get comfortable with some basic notation.

---
## Some general notes on notation

- Notation can seem scary, overwhelming, confusing. 

- Notation can be incredibly helpful for communicating precisely and clearly

- Our goal is to demystify notation

---
## General Notation: Populations and Samples

- $U$: Population of units:
  - Finite population $U = {1,2,3,\dots,N}$
  - Infinite super population $U = {1,2,3,\dots,\infty}$
- $S$: sample of size $n$ from population $U$

---
## General Notation: Outcome Variables

- $Y_i$: Observed outcome from unit $i$
  - $Y_i$ might be whether persion $i$, call them Paul has Covid while $Y_j$ would be whether person $j$, call them Aleks has Covid

---
## General Notation: Treatment Variables

- $D_i$: An indicator for the receipt of treatment. $D_i$ = 1 if treated, $D_i$ = 0 if untreated,
  - $D_i = 0$ means Paul got the placebo in a vaccine trial
  - $D_i = 1$ means Paul got the vaccine
  - Generalizes to multiple treatments $D \in \{0,1,2,3, \dots\}$

- $Z_i$: An indicator for the assignment of treatment. $Z_i$ = 1 if assigned to treatment, $Z_i$ = 0 if assigned to control,
  - $Z_i = 1$ means Paul was assigned to receive the vaccine. Whether Paul got the vaccine depends on $D_i$

---
## General Notation: Observed and Unobserved Covariates

- $X_i$ pre-treatment covariates.
  - $X_i$ might be Paul's age, or gender, or partisan affiliation
  - Pre-treatment refers to things that are determined before the treatment is assigned and therefore cannot be influenced by the treatment
  
  
- $U_i$ unobserved potential confounds
  - $_i$ might be something we didn't or can't measure like Paul's genome or general crankiness 

---
## General Notation: Expected Values

- The $E[Y]$ reads as "the expected value of Y"

- $E[Y]$ is defined as a probability weighted average based on the uncoditional probability of Y ( $f(y)$ )

$$\operatorname{E}[Y] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty y f(y)\, dy$$


---
## General Notation: Conditional Expectations

- The $E[Y|X=x]$ reads as "the expected value of Y conditional on the value of X"

- $E[Y|X=x]$ is defined as a probability weighted average of Y based on the conditional probability of Y given X ( $y f_{Y|X}(y|x)$ )

$$\operatorname{E}[Y \vert X=x] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty y f (y\vert x) \, dy$$


---
## General Notation: Expected Values

- Don't worry about the math in this course.

- We'll talk more expected values during our discussion of probability

- For now, just think of $E[Y]$ and $E[Y|X=x]$ as a theoretical averages which we can estimate from the empirical means in our data (`mean(data$y)`, `mean(data$y[data$x == 1]`))

---
## Potential Outcomes Notation:

- Potential outcomes notation is a way of describing counterfactuals

--

- $Y_i(d)$ is the value of the outcome if $D_i$ was $d$
  
  - $Y_i(1)$ is the vote share of Rep. Smith when they support \#MeToo
  
  - $Y_i(0)$ is the vote share of Rep. Smith when they do not support \#MeToo.

--

- Potential outcomes are fixed, but we only observe one (of many) potential outcomes $\to$ *Fundamental Problem of Causal Inferenece*

---
## Fundamental Problem of Causal Infernece

The individual causal effect (ICE), $\tau_i$, of some treatment $d_i$ on some observation $i$ is 

$$
\tau_i \equiv Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)
$$

- The **fundamental problem of causal inference** is that we only ever see one potential outcome for an individual, and so it's **impossible to know** the causal effect of some intervention for that individual

- The ICE is unidentified

- Example:
  - Paul got the vaccine. The individual effect of the vaccine on Paul is the difference in his health status when he got the vaccine compared to his health status when he got the placebo. But we only observe one of these two potential outcomes.

# 💡
# Causal Identification
## *What assumptions do we need to make for a causal claim to be credible*

---
## Identification

- Identification refers to what we can learn from the data available

- A quantity of interest is *identified* if, with infinite data it can only take one value

- Mathematically, we'll sometimes say a coefficient in an equation is unidentified if 

  - We have more predictors than observations, or 
  - Some of predictors are linear combinations of other predictors.

---
## Causal Identification

- **Casual Identification** refers to "the assumptions needed for statistical estimates to be given a causal interpretation" [Keele (2015)](http://lukekeele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/causal.pdf)

- **What's  Your Casual Identification Strategy:** What are the assumptions that make your research design credible?

- Identification > Estimation

---
## Observational vs Experimental Designs

- **Experimental designs** are studies in which a causal variable of interest, the *treatement*, is manipulated by the researcher to examine its causal effects on some *outcome* of interest

- **Observational designs** are studies in which a causal variable of interest is assigned by someone other than the researcher (nature, governments, people)


---

# 💡
# Causal Identification in Experimental Designs

---
## The FPoCI is a problem of missing data

That an individual causal effect $\tau_i$, is defined as:

$$
\tau_i \equiv Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)
$$

The problem is that for any one individual, we only observe $Y_i(1)$  or $Y_i(0)$, but never both.

- If Paul got the vaccine $(Y_{Paul}(Vaxxed)=\text{Covid Free})$, then we don't know what Paul's health status would have been, had he not got the vaccine $(Y_{Paul}(Unvaxxed) =???)$

---
## A statistical solution to the FPoCI
    
Rather than individual causal effects:

$$
\tau_i \equiv Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)
$$

Focus on average causal effects

$$
E[\tau_i] = \overbrace{E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]}^{\text{Average of a difference}} = \overbrace{E[Y_i(1)] - E[Y_i(0)]}^{\text{Difference of Averages}}
$$

When does the difference of averages provide us with a good estimate of the average difference?

## The hospital example

Want to know the effect of going to the hospital on people need to go to the hospital

$$
\text{What we want} = E[Y(1|D=1) - Y(0|D=1)]
$$

$$
\text{What we want} = E[\text{Mortality}(\text{Hospital}|\text{Sick}) - \text{Mortality}(\text{No Hospital}|\text{Sick})]
$$

---
## The hospital example


Instead we might end up comparing outcomes among the sick and non-sick

$$\text{What we estimate} = E[Y(1|D=1)] - E[Y(0|D=0)]$$


$$\text{What we estimate} = E[\text{Mortality}(\text{Hospital})] - E[\text{Mortality}(\text{No Hospital})]$$

---
## Selection bias

The hospital example illustrates the general problem of selection bias

$$\widehat{SATE}=\overbrace{\textbf{E[Y(1)|D=1]} - E[Y(0)|D=1]}^{\text{Average Effect of Treatment on Treated}}\\
\underbrace{+ E[Y(0)|D=1]- \textbf{E[Y(0)|D=0]}}_{\text{Selection Bias}}$$

- The bold quantities are things we can **observe** (estimate)
- $E[Y(0)|D=1]$ is a an unobservable counterfactual. 
- It's the average health outcomes of people who went to the hospital $(D=1)$ if they hadn't $(Y(0)|D=1)$

---
## Selection bias

- Adding and subtracting $E[Y(0)|D=1]$ thing doesn't change the equation but it allows us to write what we can estimate in terms of two quantities:

- The **Average Treatment Effect on the Treated:** $\mathbf{E[Y(1)|D=1]} - E[Y(0)|D=1]$
  - This is what we **want to know** if we want to make causal claims about the effect of health care

- **Selection Bias:** $E[Y(0)|D=1] - \mathbf{E[Y(0)|D=0]}$, 
    - This is the difference in health outcomes between healthy folks who didn't go to the hospital $(Y(0)|D=0)$ and sick folks who went to the hopsital had they not gone $(Y(0)|D=1)$
    - This what **confounds our causal claims** if we just compare outcomes among people who went to the hospital and people who didn't
    - Selection bias equals 0 if $E[Y(0)|D=1] = \mathbf{E[Y(0)|D=0]}$
    - $E[Y(0)|D=1] = \mathbf{E[Y(0)|D=0]}$ if **D has been randomly assigned**

---
## Random Assignment "Solves" the Problem of Selection Bias

Randomly assigning treatments creates *statistical independence* $(\unicode{x2AEB})$ between treatment ( $D$ ) and potential outcomes ( $Y(1),Y(0)$ ) as well as any observed ( $X$ ) or unobserved confounders ( $U$ ):

$$Y_i(1),Y_i(0),\mathbf{X_i},\mathbf{U_i} \unicode{x2AEB} D_i$$

---
## Random Assignment "Solves" the Problem of Selection Bias

When treatment has been randomly assigned, what we can observe ( $E[Y_i|D=0], E[Y_i|D=1]$ ), provides good (unbiased) estimates of theoretical quantities we want observe

$$E[Y_i|D=0] = E[Y_i(0)|D=0] = E[Y_i(0)] = E[Y_i(0)|D=1]$$

$$E[Y_i|D=1] = E[Y_i(1)|D=1] = E[Y_i(1)] = E[Y_i(1)|D=0]$$

---
## Estimating an Average Treatment Effect

If we treatment as been randomly assigned, we can estimate the ATE by taking the difference of means between treatment and control:

$$
\begin{align*}
E \left[ \frac{\sum_1^m Y_i}{m}-\frac{\sum_{m+1}^N Y_i}{N-m}\right]&=\overbrace{E \left[ \frac{\sum_1^m Y_i}{m}\right]}^{\substack{\text{Average outcome}\\
\text{among treated}\\ \text{units}}}
-\overbrace{E \left[\frac{\sum_{m+1}^N Y_i}{N-m}\right]}^{\substack{\text{Average outcome}\\
\text{among control}\\ \text{units}}}\\
&= E [Y_i(1)|D_i=1] -E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]
\end{align*}
$$

That is, the ATE is causally identified by the **difference of means** estimator in an experimental design

---
## Causal Identification with Experimental Designs

Causal identification for an experiment, requires very few assumptions:

--

- **Independence** (Satisfied by Randomization)
  - $Y(1), Y(0),X,U, \perp D$
- **SUTVA** Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (Depends on features of the design)
  - No interference between units $Y_i(d_1, d_2, \dots, d_N) = Y_i(d_i)$
  - No hidden values of the treatment/Variation in the treatment 


---
## Random Assignment creates testable implications

- If treatment has been randomly assigned, we would expect that there should be few differences between **pre-treatment covariates** in our treatment and control groups.

--

- That is, on average, the only the thing that should differ between these groups is that one group got the treatment and one group did not.

--

- If the treatment had an effect, than we can credibly claim that that effect was due to the presence or absence of the treatment, and not some alternative explanation.

--

- This type of clean counterfactual comparison is what people mean when they talk about an *experimental ideal*

---
## No Causation without Manipulation?

- "No causation without manipulation" - [Holland (1986)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2289064)
- Causal effects are well defined when we can imagine manipulating (changing) the value of $D_i$ and only $D_i$
- But what about the "effects" of things like:
  - Race
  - Sex
  - Democracy
- Studying the effects of these factors requires strong theory and clever design [Sen and Wasow (2016)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/race_causality.pdf)

# Causal Inference

--

- Causal Claims involve counterfactual comparisons

--

- The fundamental problem of causal inference is that for an individual only observe one of many potential outcomes

--

- Causal identification refers to the assumptions necessary to generate credible causal estimates

--

- Experimental designs are identified by the random assignment of treatment which allows us to produce unbiased estimates of the **Average Treatment Effect**

--

- Estimates are unbiased if, on average, they're equal to the trut $(E[\hat{\theta} - \theta] = 0 )$

--

- Two kinds of bias:
  - Confounding occurs when we **fail to control** for factors that influence both our outcome and explanatory variables
  - Colliding bias occurs when we **control** for factors influenced by both our outcome and explanatory variables

## Study Design :A placebo-controlled field experiment

1. Recruited from voter files to complete a baseline survey
2. Among those who complete the survey, half are assigned to receive an intervention  and half are assigned to receive a placebo 
3. Only some are actually home or open the door when the canvassers knock. 
4. These people are then recruited to participate in a series of surveys 3 days, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months after the initial intervention.
