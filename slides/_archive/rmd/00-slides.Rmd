## Goals and Expectations

---

## What you will learn

You will learn 

--

- how to think like a social scientist

--

--

- how to use data to make descriptive, predictive, and causal claims

--

--

- how to quantify uncertainty about these claims

--

--

- how to present, interpret, and critique these claims

## Why is this study important?

--
- Findings provide evidence of benefits of social spending/universal basic income

--

## Why should we believe these results

--
- Because it's in the *Times*?

--
- Because the authors are professors at *good* schools?


- Because of how the study was done!

--
  - **Random assignment** provides a reasoned basis for inference
  - Creates informative **counter-factual comparisons**
  - **Pre-registered hypotheses** ensure that we're not cherry-picking results


---
## Why might we be skeptical of these results?

- How strong are the effects?
  - Is a fifth of a standard deviation a lot?
- Why do we care about brain waves?
- What's the mechanism?
- How confident are we that these results couldn't have happened just by chance

    y <- 2*x + rnorm(100)
    ```
    
- Write up in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## Getting set up for the course:

Here's a [link to a guide](file:///Users/ptesta/git/pols1600_site/static/labs/00-software_setup.html#6_Install_packages) to get you setup for the course.

Take a crack at it after class, over the weekend.

Email me with any issues (there are always issues), and drop by my office hours on Tuesday so we can trouble shoot.

## Textbook

```{r, echo=F,out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://pup-assets.imgix.net/onix/images/9780691222288.jpg?w=1500&auto=format")
```

## How to Read Imai

- Active reading

- Copy and run the code in the text. To do so, do the following:

```{r, eval=F}
if (!require("devtools")){
  install.packages("devtools")
  }
library("devtools")
install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package",  
               build_vignettes  =  TRUE)
```

---
## How to Read Imai

Once you've rune the following

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


Anywhere the text loads data:

```{r, eval=F}
afghan <- read_csv("afgahn.csv")
```

You can do 
```{r}
library("qss")
data("afghan")
summary(afghan$age)
```

---
## Additional Readings

- Occasionally, I will provide additional readings, available on both Canvas and pols1600.paultesta.org

# Assignments


---
## Assignments

You have three types of assignments in this course

---
## Labs



```{r,echo=F,out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cw1.png")
```

  - Complete the lab
  - Upload html file to Canvas by the end of class
- One question randomly graded

	 + 85% if incorrect, but you tried
	 + 0% if you did not try/absent for the lab
- Comments/Answers posted immediately after class


---
## Problem Sets/Tutorials

- Coding tutorials to reinforce concepts from lecture and textbook. 
- Accessed by running

```{r, eval=F}
learnr::run_tutorial("00-intro", package = "qsslearnr")
```

- Complete the tutorial. Save output as "LASTNAME_TutorialNumber.pdf"

## My research

- I study American Poltical Behavior with focus on poltics of race and criminal justice
- How do we break cycles of inequality when those most affected by injustice are the least likely to participate and those unaffected are the least likely to care?
- How can we use methodological tools to better answer these questions?
