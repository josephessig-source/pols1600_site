## What was this course about?

--

- How would you know?

--

- How would convince someone who thinks they know different?

--

- What would it take to change what you think you know?

---
## Why Quantitative Social Science?

What makes for quantitative social science 

- Compelling?

- Useful?

- Hard?

--

Statistical methods and programming are tools not answers 

--

Producing knowledge requires us to match theory with empirical design

--

Being "right" is less important than understanding all the ways you might be wrong. 

--

Good social science is urgent, eclectic, transparent, contingent, and ?


## What you've learned

Skills and concepts to help understand and practice quantitative social science

- **Causal Inference** is about counterfactual comparisons
  
  - Experimental designs $\to$ random assignment
  
  - Observational design $\to$ identifying assumptions $\to$ conditional independence

- **Regression** is a tool for describing relationships

  - OLS provides a linear approximation of the Conditional Expectation Function
  
  - Regression can be used for descriptive, predictive, and causal inference. 

- **Statistical inference** is about quantifying uncertainty about what could have happened

  - Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for we observed
  
  - Hypothesis tests describe the conditional probability of observing what we did, if some hypothesis were true.

## How'd I do?

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
#| echo = F

df%>%
  ggplot(aes(eval_2))+
  geom_density()+
  geom_rug()
```
]

---
## How'd you do?

```{r}
#| echo = F,
#| fig.height = 6

df%>%
  ggplot(aes(eval_1,eval_3, col = eval_2))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope =1)+
  xlim(0,100)+
  ylim(0,100)+
  labs(
    x = "You",
    y = "Your Peers",
    col = "Me"
  )+theme_bw()
```


---
## Are you happy you took POLS 1600?


---
```{r}
#| echo = F
df %>%
  mutate(
    Happy = case_when(
      happy == 1 ~ "Yes",
      happy == 2 ~ "No",
      T ~ "Just here for the tacos"
    ),
    Happy = factor(Happy, levels = c("Just here for the tacos","No","Yes"))
  )  %>%
  ggplot(aes(Happy, fill = Happy))+
  geom_bar(stat = "count")+
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}

                pageLength = 2
              )
              )
```

## What I'll Do


- Lectures: 
  - Less is more
  - How much math...
  - More supplemental content (class notes)
  - More active learning
  - Integrating the textbook

--

- Labs: 
  - Seemed to work ok
  - Group work vs individual learning?
  - Greater integration with textbook and lecture

--

- Assignments and Grading
  - Mostly liked the group project
  - Tutorials were helpful
  - More individualized assignments/accountability?

---

> "What’s one thing (or more, if applicable) that you’re really glad to did in college?"

- Wrote for the school paper

> "What’s one thing (or more) you wish you had done?" 

- Taken more math classes...

> "What’s one thing (or more) you wish you hadn’t done? Can be school or social or planning for post college related"

- Slept in because I worked late at the paper

---

> "Are there academic careers in PoliSci that aren't math/statistics based?"

--

- Yes! Why do you ask?

---

> "Did you doubt yourself throughout your higher education career? How did you overcome it? Oftentimes, I have very high standards for myself that I am not capable of meeting and which bring a lot of shame. I fear my ability to succeed and actually obtain the career I seek requires skills, abilities, and experience that I never seem any closer to acquiring. Did you think you would end up here at Brown? How DID you end up at Brown?"
