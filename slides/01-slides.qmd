## Why do you ask?

It's cousin Nick's fault...

-   Funny icebreaker, but lots of assumptions...

    -   You're not a murderer

    -   You don't know someone who's committed a murder or been murdered

    -   You've got a mom and dad

## Why do you ask?

-   How might we make this question better?

    -   Use a screener question
        -   "Would you feel comfortable..."
    -   "Pipe" in responses from a prior question
        -   "Who are two people who raised you..."

## The Basics of R

- R is an interpreter (\>)

  - Everything that [exists]{.blue} in R is an [object]{.blue}

  - Everything that [happens]{.blue} in R is the [result of a function]{.blue}

- Data come in different types, shapes, and sizes

- Packages extend what R can do

  - `install.packages("pacakge_name")` once to download a package
  - load packages [every session]{.blue} using `library("package_name")`

## R is an interpreter (\>)

Enter commands line-by-line in the console

-   The `>` means R is a ready for a command

-   The `+` means your last command isn't complete

    -   If you get stuck with a `+` use your escape key!

-   Send code from .qmd file to the console:

    -   `cntrl + Enter` (PC) \| `cmd + Return` (Mac) -\> run current line
    -   `cntrl + shift + Enter` (PC) \| `cmd + shift  + Return` (Mac) -\> run all code in current chunk

## R is a Calculator

```{r}
#| include = FALSE
math_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Operator, ~Description, ~Usage,
  "+", "addition", "x + y",
  "-", "subtraction", "x - y",
  "*", "multiplication", "x * y",
  "/", "division", "x / y",
  "^", "raised to the power of", "x ^ y",
  "abs", "absolute value", "abs(x)",
  "%/%", "integer division", "x %/% y",
  "%%", "remainder after division", "x %% y"
)
```

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| results = "asis"
knitr::kable(math_table, format = "html")
```

## R is logical

```{r}
#| include = FALSE
logic_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Operator, ~Description, ~Usage,
  "&", "and", "x & y",
  "|", "or", "x | y",
  "xor", "exactly x or y", "xor(x, y)",
  "!", "not", "!x"
)
```

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| results = "asis"
knitr::kable(logic_table, format = "html")
```

## R is logical

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false

x == T
x == T & y == T
x == T | y == T

```

## R can make comparisons {.smaller}

```{r}

  ">", "greater than", "x > y",
  ">=", "greater than or equal to", "x >= y",
  "==", "exactly equal to", "x == y",
  "!=", "not equal to", "x != y",
  "%in%", "group membership*", "x %in% y",
  "is.na", "is missing", "is.na(x)",
  "!is.na", "is not missing", "!is.na(x)"
)
```

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| results = "asis"
knitr::kable(comp_table, format = "html")
```

## Everything that exists in R is an object {.smaller}

::: nonincremental
-   The number 5 is an object in R

```{r}
#| echo: true
5
```

-   We can assign the object 5, the name x, using the assignment operator `<-`

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- 5 # Read this as "x gets 5"
```

-   Now if we tell R to show us x, we'll get

```{r}
#| echo: true

x
print(x)
```

One common portal of discovery, is that a function in R is expecting data of one type but (e.g. `numeric`) but actually gets data of different type (e.g. `character`)

The `class()` function is a useful `base R` for troubleshooting such errors.

## Everything that happens in R is the result of a function

-   You've already seen and used some R functions
    -   the `<-` is the assignement operator that assigns a value to a name
    -   `c()` is the combine function that combines elements together
    -   `install.packages()` installs packages
    -   `library()` loads packages you've installed so you can use functions and data that are part of that package

## Three sources of functions {.smaller}

Three sources of functions:

-   base R
    -   `<-; mean(x); library("package_name")`
-   packages
    -   `install.packages("packageName)"`
    -   `remotes::intall_github("user/repository")`
-   You
    -   `my_function <- function(x){x^2}`

## Getting setup to work in R

Each time you start a project in R, you will want to:

-   Set your working directory in R Studio

-   Load (and if needed, install) the R packages you will use

-   Set any "global" options you want

-   Load the data you'll be using

## Set your working directory

![](https://statisticsglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/figure-2-set-working-directory-to-source-file-location-manually.png)

## Load (and if needed, install) the R packages you will use

::: nonincremental
-   Install packages [once]{.blue}[^1] with `install.packages("package_name")`

-   Load packages [every session]{.blue} with `library("package_name")`
:::

[^1]: Occasionally, you'll have to update packages to newer versions and will likely need to reinstall when you upgrade R

## {{<fa code >}} Install packages for the lab {.inverse}

## Install packages for the lab {.smaller}

Let's install the `tidyverse` and `COVID19`.

::: nonincremental
-   Create a new code chunk
-   Label it `libraries`
-   Copy and paste the following into your console
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("COVID19")
```

::: nonincremental
-   Once you've installed these packages comment out the code (Why?)
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("COVID19")
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts to toggle `#` comments

macOS: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `C`

PC: `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `C`

:::

## Loading the `tidyverse` and `COVID19` packages

-   Type the following into your code chunk:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(COVID19)
```


## Load the data you'll be using {.smaller}

There are three ways to load data.

- Load a [pre-existing]{.blue} dataset
  - `data("dataset")` will load the dataset named "dataset"
    - `data()` will list all datasets

- Load a .Rdata/.rda file using `load("dataset.rda")`

- Read data of a different format (.csv, .dta, .spss) into R using specific functions from packages like `haven` and `readr`

:::{.fragment}

```{r}
#| eval: false

# EXAMPLE CODE (Won't actually run)
# Read a .csv file saved locally on my Desktop
df_csv <- readr::read_csv("~/Desktop/data.csv")
# Read a .dta file saved on the web

## Loading data into R {.smaller}

There are three ways to load data.

-   Load a pre-existing dataset
    -   `data("dataset")` will load the dataset named "dataset"
    -   `data()` will list all datasets

-   Load a .Rdata/.rda file using `load("dataset.rda")`
-   Read data of a different format (.csv, .dta, .spss) into R using specific functions

-   `end = "2022-12-31""` sets the end date for the data
-   `level = 2` tells the function we want state-level data
-   `verbose = F` tells the function not to print other stuff
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|3|4-5|6|7"

covid <- COVID19::covid19(
  country = "US",
  start = "2020-01-01",
  end = "2022-12-31",
  level = 2,
  verbose = F
    
)

```

## Looking at your data {.smaller}

The first time you load a dataset into R, you should try to get a [high-level overview (HLO)]{.blue} of the data

:::{.callout-tip}

This is an iterative, dynamic process. Something you do "live" but won't necessarily save in your final code you submit. Over time you'll develop intuitions about what to look for, what questions to ask of your data, and what functions and code will help you answer these questions. 

For example, I might want to know, how many unique values the variable `school_closing` in the `covid` dataset takes? 

:::


```{r}

table(covid$school_closing)

```


## HLOs allow you to {.smaller}

-   Describe the [structure]{.blue} of your data:
    -   How many observations (rows)
    -   How many variables (columns)
-   Describe the [unit of observation]{.blue}
    -   In plain language, what *is* a row in your data
-   Identify the [class and type]{.blue} of variables (columns)
    -   Numeric, character, logical
    -   Is there missing data (`NA`s)
-   Figure out what [transformations, cleaning, and recoding]{.blue} you need to do


## Functions to help you get a high level overview {.smaller}

-   `dim(data)` gives you the dimensions (# of rows and columns)
-   `View(data)` opens data in a separate pane
-   `print(data); data` will display a truncated view of data in your console
-   `glimpse(data)` will show a transposed (switch columns and rows) version of data with information on variable type
-   `head(data)` shows you the first 5 rows
-   `tail(data)` shows you the last 5 rows
-   `data$variable` extracts `variable` from `data`
-   `table(data$variable)` creates a frequency table
    -   Good for categorical data
-   `table(data$variable1, data$variable2)` creates a  "crosstab" or contingency table
    -   Great for checking recodes of data
-   `summary(data$variable)` summary statistics
    -   Good for numeric data

## Tidy Data

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure.

A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:

-   Every column is a variable.

-   Every row is an observation.

-   Every cell is a single value.

[More](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)

## `dplyr` functions for data wrangling {.smaller}

Today and this week will begin learning some tools for selecting and transforming data:

-   `select()` to select [columns]{.blue} from a dataframe
-   `filter()` to select [rows]{.blue} from a dataframe when some [statement]{.blue} is `TRUE`
-   `mutate()` to create [new colums]{.blue}
    -   `case_when()` to [recode values]{.blue} when some [statement]{.blue} is `TRUE`
-   `summarise()` to transform [many values]{.blue} into [one value]{.blue}
-   `group_by()` to create a [grouped]{.blue} table so that other functions are applied separately to each group and then combined

## The `%>%` ("pipe" operator) {.smaller}

The `%>%` lets us chain functions together so we can read left to right

```{r}
#| eval = F
slice(filter(covid, administrative_area_level_2 == "Rhode Island"), 1)
```

Becomes

```{r}
#| eval = F
covid %>% 
  filter(administrative_area_level_2 == "Rhode Island") %>% 
  slice(1)
```

## Using R to Summarize Data {.smaller}

Here are some common ways of summarizing data and how to calculate them with `R`

```{r}
#| echo = F
summary_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Description, ~Usage,
  "sum", "sum(x)",
  "minimum", "min(x)",
  "maximum", "max(x)",
  "range", "range(x)",
  "mean", "mean(x)",
  "median", "median(x)",
  "percentile", "quantile(x)",
   "variance", "var(x)",
  "standard deviation", "sd(x)",
  "rank", "rank(x)"
)
```

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| results = "asis"
knitr::kable(summary_table, format = "html")
```

All of these functions have an argument called `na.rm=F`. If your data have missing values, you'll need to set `na.rm=F` (e.g. `mean(x, na.rm=T)`)

## Exploring Covid-19 Data for Lab

Let's spend the rest of class, exploring what seems like a simple question

> On average, did states that adopted mask mandates have lower rates of new cases?

## Tasks

1.  Get a high level overview of our data

2.  Subset the data to just U.S. States

3.  Recode our data to get a measure of new Covid cases and what face mask policy policy was in place

4.  Summarize the average number of new cases by face mask policy.

## 1. Get a high level overview of our data

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
::: nonincremental
1.  Create a new chunk
2.  Label it `#| label:"HLO"`
3.  Run the following code
4.  Comment code with `#`
:::
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
#| eval = F

dim(covid)
head(covid)
glimpse(covid)
table(covid$administrative_area_level_2)
length(unique(covid$administrative_area_level_2))
covid$confirmed[1:10]
covid %>%
  select(administrative_area_level_2, date, confirmed) %>%
  slice(10:20)
summary(covid$confirmed)
table(covid$facial_coverings)

```
:::
:::

## Answer the following

::: nonincremental
-   How many observations are there (rows)
-   How many variables (columns)
-   What's the unit of observation?
    -   In words, how would you describe what a row in your data set corresponds to?
-   Are there any missing values for `confirmed`
-   What range of values can `facial_coverings` take?[^4]
:::

[^4]: See: https://covid19datahub.io/articles/docs.html

## Subsetting our data to only U.S. States

[Goal:]{.blue} Subset our Covid data to include only the 50 states + DC

[Steps:]{.blue}

1.  Create a vector of the territories we **don't** want

2.  Use the `filter()` command to "filter" out these territories

## 1. Create a vector of the territories we **don't** want

```{r}
territories <- c(
  "American Samoa",
  "Guam",
  "Northern Mariana Islands",
  "Puerto Rico",
  "Virgin Islands"
  )
```

## 2. Use the `filter()` command to "filter" out these territories

```{r}
covid_us <- covid %>%
  filter(!administrative_area_level_2 %in% territories )

dim(covid)
dim(covid_us)
```

## Creating new variables for analysis

-   [Goal:]{.blue} We need new variables that describe:

    -   the number of new Covid-19 cases on a given date

    -   the face mask policy in place

-   [Steps:]{.blue}

    -   Use `mutate()`, `group_by()` and `lag()` to calculate `new_cases` from total `confirmed` cases

    -   Use `mutate()`, `case_when()` and `abs()` to turn numeric `facial_coverings` into categorical factor variable

## Calculate new Covid-19 cases

Please run and comment the following code:

```{r}

dim(covid_us)
covid_us %>%
  mutate(
    state = administrative_area_level_2,
  ) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(
    new_cases = confirmed - lag(confirmed),
    new_cases_pc = new_cases/population *100000
    ) -> covid_us
dim(covid_us)

```

## Create Face Mask Policy variable

```{r}
covid_us %>%
  mutate(
    face_masks = case_when(
      facial_coverings == 0 ~ "No policy",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 1 ~ "Recommended",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 2 ~ "Some requirements",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 3 ~ "Required shared places",
      abs(facial_coverings) == 4 ~ "Required all times",
      
    ) 
  ) -> covid_us

levels(factor(covid_us$face_masks))
```

## Make `face_masks` a factor to reflect order of policies

```{r}
levels(factor(covid_us$face_masks))

covid_us %>%
  mutate(
    face_masks = factor(
      face_masks,
      levels = c(
        "No policy", 
        "Recommended", 
        "Some requirements",
        "Required shared places",
        "Required all times"
        )
    )
  ) -> covid_us

levels(covid_us$face_masks)
```

## Calculate the Average Number of Covid-19 cases by Face Mask Policy

-   [Goal:]{.blue} On average, did states that adopted mask mandates have lower rates of new cases?

-   [Steps:]{.blue} use `filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarise()` and `mean()` to calculate the average number of cases for each level of the `face_masks` policy variable

## Face Masks and New Covid-19 Cases (per 100k)

```{r}
covid_us %>%
  filter(!is.na(face_masks))%>%
  group_by(face_masks)%>%
  summarize(
    `Average No. of New Cases` = round(mean(new_cases_pc, na.rm=T),2)
  )%>%
  rename(
    "Face Mask Policy" = face_masks
  ) -> face_mask_summary
