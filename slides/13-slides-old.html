Even though it’s all a little sticky in my head, I’m glad I took this course. I also have a decent understanding of how r works so that’s pretty cool! I wish we’d worked through understanding the foundational stuff more and did a little less copy and paste because I think that would have helped me a lot with the final project/paper.","Group projects","","Working in a group for our work definitely helped a lot.","That Testa fellow was pretty great.  I thought the labs were really really helpful too.  Especially as the semester went on.  We ended up getting to a point where the balance of \"fitting lots of stuff in\" and \"having enough time to actually work through the whole lab\" got good, and so I really looked forward to those.  I also enjoyed the final project a bunch, I thought it was cool to get to apply everything.","I loved the lecture/lab structure of the course and working with my lab group!","","I thought the projects worked out quite well. The concepts for the class became more concrete when I had to apply them. Though the labs were difficult at first, they helped me understand concepts and how to do this coding thing. The learner tutorials were quite helpful. \n\nSimilarly, the sample final project was quite useful for working on the final project. Looking at the project helped me both practically and theoretically. \n\nAlso I think you're quite willing to work with students one on one, which, I think, helped a lot of us. Big props for that.","I actually did like the final project- it really helped me understand linear regression and data analysis which I did not have a grasp on initially.","Your easygoing approach made it less stressful to be in a class with entirely unfamiliar material","","I liked the structure of the course, the website was super well organized all semester so it was always easy to follow along. I didn’t always find the coding experience itself fruitful but besides that I liked the course. I also liked my group members.","The group focused work helped provide a very valuable community within the class format, which helped for working past issues and questions during labs and projects. Office hours were always accessible and frequent feedback made navigating the course and class assignments easy.","I like that it was very beginner R friendly. I know I’m not a CS person and stats terrify me but I after trying, I could kind of keep up.","I enjoyed your encouragement and efforts to keep us engaged through entertaining lectures, anecdotes, corny jokes, etc. I often find that this is what makes or breaks a class, i.e. the attitude and dedication of the professor.","I thought Professor Testa was incredibly helpful throughout the whole course in helping us understand the concepts and being patient enough to repeat himself when we were struggling! The support we received in labs and office hours made all the difference.","I really enjoyed the labs and progressively learning how to navigate basic coding through working with different datasets and questions. I enjoyed learning the basics of data visualization and generally am happy with the introduction this course provided me with to R.","The Professor! I have repeatedly failed at maths and it generally scares me, having a nice professor is super important and I really appreciated Professor Testa.\n\nLabs and tutorials were a good structure. Lectures in class could often be complex and beyond what I could ever really aim to understand in this course, but tutorials meant I could nail down some basic skills.\n\nThis course was generally super useful though; it's exactly the right kind of course for IAPA and PoliSci students and will help me a bunch in other courses. I felt it introduced an area that I was unfamiliar with before but now know more about, and know what I need to know more about.","The variety of ways to practice learning: reading the textbook, doing tutorials, doing group labs, walking through things in class, etc.\n\nEncouragement to ask questions. The amount of encouragement overall was really nice!"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Likes<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":4,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"Likes","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[4,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Not knowing why something wasn't knitting was especially frustrating at times.","The learning curve for the course was especially steep.  It really felt like walking around in the dark and slamming my head into walls at the beginning.  That got better with time.  I also never really was able to make great use of the lectures, or the whole theoretical side in general.  I have some background in statistics, and sometimes when concepts would be explained I found myself more confused than when I started.  And for concepts that I didn't come in with a knowledge of, I found it hard to wrap my head around.  The labs always felt more valuable than the lectures, and that gap got particularly massive as the semester went on and the labs got better.  I'll admit that I didn't keep up with the textbook except to get through the tutorials, so that's part of the problem for me for sure.  But the gap between theory and practice always felt large.","","","Textbook: Honestly, not super good. I stopped reading it. When I needed help, I'd either go to office hours or look online. \nLectures: Good stuff. Looking at the slides after the class wasn't super helpful, though. They only really worked with the lectures. \n\nBasically, I think the biggest issue with the course was accountability. I think the group projects/group lab assignments led to only some people (those who turned in the assignment for the group) learning from them. Maybe the class should have the same assignment load, but have them all be independent projects. That would've forced me to learn more, I think. As the class works right now, I just put in a lot of work over the last few weeks and learned that way. That's good in a way, but I think I could've learned more if the workload had been spread out over the semester. Maybe having conceptual quizzes would've been good, I'm not sure.  Or maybe the research project can begin at the beginning of the semester? I'm just thinking out loud here...\n","I think the group structure of the class is difficult, some members of the group did not contribute and I had to do much more work on the final project than I expected.","Classes moved too quickly for me to be able to follow along on my own computer. I don't type fast enough and by the time I got an error we had moved on","","I had no experience with stats or coding before, so a lot of the statistical content was hard to follow. Also the coding itself was not that fruitful at times, especially in the first half of the course. But I thought it was pretty much as good of an experience as it could’ve been.","I would have preferred less of a focus on statistics and more of a focus on coding. However, I appreciated the variation in material  and felt that I gained something from the inclusion of coding and statistics material in the class.","I wish there was less stats theory, a lot of it confused me and distracted me from what I was meant to absorb.","I found that I was able to get away with not doing much of the work that I would have benefitted from. For instance, the tutorials could often be completed without having actually learned anything. Group assignments also made it easier for many to get away with knowing less. This is, in many ways, my own fault and will come at the cost of not getting as much out of the class due to my own laziness. However, certain things could be tweaked so that students are forced to learn more. A major assignment (project, test, paper, etc.) could be given that does not rely on group efforts for example. Having said that, I did learn in this course and am far more familiar with r than I was beforehand!","I thought the lectures overall were quite dry, and could have used more built in break/discussion time.","The lectures, while very helpful, were dense and difficult to digest at times simply because of the extent of information included. Though it’s difficult to imagine a different way to squeeze all the content in across 14 weeks.","Lectures often went super complex and it felt like a rush to cram in as much as possible. If there were less content I think I could have focused more on understanding the key concepts more.","Maybe problem-set-type assignments could be more central in how we learn and do work.\n\nTA\n\nMore time on math. I think right now it's worst of both worlds in the sense that there's enough math explanation that we feel like it is important, but not enough that we understand it, leading to a fair amount of confusion or at least lack of confidence. Dedicating a week or two to really getting down the mathematical basis for the content could be really helpful\n\nMaking slides and notes downloadable as .Rmd files"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Disliked<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":3,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"Disliked","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[3,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I hate R Studio much less now.  I actually truly think that I could use it in another practical setting.

In that last lecture when you summarized each of the statistical concepts, I kept having moments of either \"oh, that's all that is?\" or \"huh, we talked about that at some point?\"  Vice versa with the previous paragraph, I would have expected to do well with this stuff given my background, but I don't feel like I made much progress on the concepts themselves.","","","Still a little confused about bootstrapping/prediction.

Not that I particularly want to know the math, but in order to understand things, my brain likes to understand deeply all of the parts that make up the whole. Having a weaker handle on the statistical concepts and actual mathematics undergirding the coding we were doing was definitely a challenge this semester.","I need to spend more time on the stats/math.

I’m proud of myself for leaning into something I’m uncomfortable/not as confident with and could’ve avoided with Brown’s open curriculum","I feel like I know way more about R and the beginnings of code","","It was a pretty chill class compared to what I was expecting.","Did I have a good time in POLS 1600?  Yes.  Am I happy that I took it in the sense that it was a requirement and I'd like to graduate with my POLS degree?  Sure.  But I think the coding stuff that I did manage to learn probably could have been done in like some coding bootcamp for a few weeks, and the statistical concepts never really stuck.  I took this class instead of a class in like \"17th century Central Asian dance\" or \"Cool Star Shit Because Space is Insane.\"  I get 32 classes in my time at Brown, and there's so much cool stuff to do and not enough time to do it.  I think this class was really practical probably, but it's also one less opportunity for me to do something mind-boggling.  My gripe is more with the concentration requirement system than the class itself I suppose.\n\nWhich is kind of a bummer, and so this question feels bad.  Because I don't necessarily think that it's super likely that the class could have changed in a way to change my answer?  The coolest thing we did was the final project by far, but even with that I guess I wasn't infatuated with our research question nor blown away by the rigor of our analysis.  That would be the only thing that I could really think about that might change my mind, if that was somehow expanded, but it may just be a case of \"you have to eat your vegetables\" here.","I learned a lot of computational skills and got more comfortable with r studio","","I learned to think in different ways, and I learned why social science is a ~science~","I always was mystified by computer science and now I feel like I understand at least some of it","Of all the quantitative class options I had to fulfill the requirement for my major I'm glad I took this one because it was low stress, but I am not interested enough in this material to want to take it if I wasn't required to.","","I know how to read social science articles now which I never knew how to do before.","I really enjoyed programming in R, especially seeing my knowledge come together in the creation of the final presentation. I feel that I have established a comfort ability with working in R that is tangible and represents growth over the semester. I also thought Professor Testa was a really great professor — incredibly kind, patient, and focused on helping students learn.","","This falls on me. If I would have dedicated more time to the course I am sure I would have learned more. I think I took POLS 1600 because I was reapplying to an internship that pointed out the benefits of having r on one's application. However, I ended up getting the internship very early on into the semester and was told that r was entirely optional. This defeated the main driving force for why I took the class and made it far more difficult for me to convince myself to do the necessary work. I would not say that I am unhappy that I took the class, but I definitely lacked a lot motivation to keep myself engaged throughout the semester.","It was really helpful in my understanding of how to combine my two majors, IAPA and AMA","I would have virtually no idea how to navigate just about anything related to R without having taken Pols 1600. I feel like I have a much better understanding of quantitative analysis and the demands of data wrangling, and I am able to appreciate empirical political science as a result","Super important area I needed to learn more about","Great professor\nCool examples explored in class\nPractical applicability of the concepts learned in class"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>happy_why<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":2,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"happy_why","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[2,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
