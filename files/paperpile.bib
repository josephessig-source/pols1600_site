               countries between 1970 and 2018. We find that higher levels of

               provision of public goods and undermines counter-terrorism
               capacity. Thus, our empirical findings are consistent with
               predictions from a game-theoretical representation of terrorism,
               according to which corruption makes terrorism relatively more
               attractive compared to peaceful contestation, while also

               elections shape policy in this important realm. We leverage
               housing policy data and a new data source of 15,621 city council
               elections and 3,261 mayoral elections in large cities in the

               We provide robust evidence that electing mayors from different
               political parties shapes cities’ housing stock. Electing a
               Democrat as mayor leads to increased multifamily housing

               (SBP) into effects via body mass index (BMI), via gamma-glutamyl

               been made, mainly due to contributions from the field of causal
               inference, in understanding the precise nature of statistical
               estimands that capture such intuitive effects, the assumptions
               under which they can be identified, and statistical methods for
               doing so. These contributions have focused almost entirely on
               settings with a single mediator, or a set of mediators considered
               en bloc; in many applications, however, researchers attempt a
               much more ambitious decomposition into numerous path-specific

              social scientists to analyze multidimensional preferences in a
              population. To characterize the structure of causal interaction in
              factorial experiments, we propose a new causal interaction effect,
              called the average marginal interaction effect (AMIE). Unlike the
              conventional interaction effect, the relative magnitude of the
              AMIE does not depend on the choice of baseline conditions, making
              its interpretation intuitive even for higher-order interactions.
              We show that the AMIE can be nonparametrically estimated using
              ANOVA regression with weighted zero-sum constraints. Because the
              AMIEs are invariant to the choice of baseline conditions, we
              directly regularize them by collapsing levels and selecting
              factors within a penalized ANOVA framework. This regularized
              estimation procedure reduces false discovery rate and further
              facilitates interpretation. Finally, we apply the proposed

              Africa and find clear patterns of causal interaction between
              politicians’ ethnicity and their prior records. The proposed

              married men may reflect both a tendency for more productive men to
              marry and an effect of marriage on productivity. To sort out these
              explanations, researchers have used fixed effects regression
              models for panel data to adjust for selection on unobserved
              time-invariant confounders, interpreting coefficients for the
              time-varying marriage variables as effects. However, they did not
              define these effects or give conditions under which the regression
              coefficients would warrant a causal interpretation. Consequently,
              they failed to appropriately adjust for important time-varying

              their data. A basic set of treatment effects is defined and used

  abstract  = "Nudges modify decision frameworks in order to steer people's
               choices in particular directions. Modifying energy consumption
               choices through nudging has shown significant promise for
               promoting sustainable consumption behaviors. However, policy
               makers have been reluctant to embrace nudges, due to concerns
               over potential ethical objections. This paper argues that the
               major ethical objections to nudging are not ultimately convincing
               when applied to energy production and consumption. The most
               common ethical objections claim that nudging is paternalistic and
               reduces human autonomy. It is argued here that energy production
               and consumption are “massively architectured,” which means that
               they are strongly influenced by factors external to individuals.
               The infrastructure and framework for producing and consuming
               energy is largely determined prior to human decision-making. As a
               result, it is not clear how nudging for sustainable energy
               consumption could be paternalistic or autonomy-reducing. Ethical
               objections should thus not be a deterrent for policy makers
               pursuing nudges for sustainable energy consumption.",

              analysis to resolve these issues or of development agencies to
              learn from their own experience. In response, there is increasing
              use in development economics of randomized controlled trials
              (RCTs) to accumulate credible knowledge of what works, without
              overreliance on questionable theory or statistical methods. When
              RCTs are not possible, the proponents of these methods advocate
              quasi-\nrandomization through instrumental variable (IV)
              techniques or natural experiments. I argue that many of these
              applications are unlikely to recover quantities that are useful
              for policy or understanding: two key issues are the
              misunderstanding of exogeneity and the handling of heterogeneity.
              I illustrate from the literature on aid and growth. Actual
              randomization faces similar problems as does quasi-randomization,
              notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary. I argue that experiments
              have no special ability to produce more credible knowledge than
              other methods, and that actual experiments are frequently subject
              to practical problems that undermine any claims to statistical or
              epistemic superiority. I illustrate using prominent experiments in
              development and elsewhere. As with IV methods, RCT-based
              evaluation of projects, without guidance from an understanding of
              underlying mechanisms, is unlikely to lead to scientific progress
              in the understanding of economic development. I welcome recent
              trends in development experimentation away from the evaluation of
              projects and toward the evaluation of theoretical mechanisms. (JEL

               implicit assumption is that comparison friction—the wedge between
               the availability of comparative information and consumers’ use of
               it—is inconsequential because information is readily available
               and consumers will access this information and make effective
               choices. We examine the extent of comparison friction in the
               market for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the United
               States. In a randomized field experiment, an intervention group
               received a letter with personalized cost information. That
               information was readily available for free and widely advertised.
               However, this additional step—providing the information rather
               than having consumers actively access it—had an impact. Plan
               switching was 28 percent in the intervention group, versus 17
               percent in the comparison group, and the intervention caused an
               average decline in predicted consumer cost of about \$100 per
               year among letter recipients—roughly 5 percent of the cost in the
               comparison group. Our results suggest that comparison friction
               can be large even when the cost of acquiring information is

              beliefs are mistaken. Political opponents respect moral beliefs
              more when they are supported by personal experiences, not facts.
              The respect-inducing power of personal experiences is revealed by
              survey studies across various political topics, a field study of
              conversations about guns, an analysis of YouTube comments from
              abortion opinion videos, and an archival analysis of 137 interview
              transcripts from Fox News and CNN. The personal experiences most
              likely to encourage respect from opponents are issue-relevant and
              involve harm. Mediation analyses reveal that these harm-related
              personal experiences increase respect by increasing perceptions of

              rational, even in people who hold different beliefs about guns,

               highly-covered by the media, draw citizens’ attention, and

               who struggle to find and pay for housing. Housing has
               historically been of interest to sociologists, but it has long
               been subsumed within research on crime, residential mobility, and
               neighborhoods. In the past decade, there has been a surge of
               scholarship in an emerging sociology of housing that focuses on
               housing insecurity, forced moves, landlords, shared housing
               arrangements, and the stratification effects of housing policy.
               While other fields typically define housing insecurity as
               affordability, this new literature shows how housing insecurity
               is not only rooted in financial constraints but also situated
               within social relationships that create or dissolve housing
               arrangements, and is exacerbated or remediated by supply-side
               institutions and policy. This work makes clear that housing
               insecurity is not a one-time discrete event but a dynamic
               process, and that sociologists can contribute not only to
               measuring housing insecurity but also to understanding the social
               forces that shape it.",

               behavior. However, the continuing and vibrant stream of work in

               of a more genuinely comparative field of political socialization,
               a reconsideration of the relevance of childhood to politics
               following its virtual abandonment by the field for many years,
               and the importance of understanding the origins of preferences.

               attempts to critically summarize current developments in the

              causal effects with observational data. The defining feature of
              the RD design is that a treatment is assigned based on whether the
              value of a score exceeds a known cutoff. We review core conceptual
              issues, discussing the differences and similarities between RD
              designs and randomized controlled experiments, the basic
              conditions for identification of RD effects, and parametric and
              nonparametric alternatives to inference. We distinguish between a
              continuity-based RD approach, which relies on the continuity of
              the relevant regression functions and justifies polynomial
              estimation and inference methods, and a randomization-based RD
              approach, which relies on the assumption of random assignment of

               Abrams shortly before the 2018 Democratic primary after she
               became the first Black woman to win a majory party's nomination
               for governor. Abrams' sentiment reflects the wider environment
               for Black women in politics, in which racist and sexist cultural
               ideas have long led Black women to be demeaned and fetishized for
               their physical appearance. In Sister Style, Nadia E. Brown and
               Danielle Casarez Lemi argue that Black women's political
               experience and the way that voters evaluate them is shaped
               overtly by their skin tone and hair texture, with hair being a
               particular point of scrutiny. They ask what the politics of
               appearance for Black women mean for Black women politicians and
               Black voters, and how expectations about self-presentation differ
               for Black women versus Black men, White men, and White women.
               Black women running for office face pressure, often from campaign
               consultants and even close colleagues, to change their style in
               order to look more like White women. However, as this book shows,
               Black women candidates and elected officials react differently to
               these pressures depending on factors like age and incumbency.
               Moreover, Brown and Lemi delve into the ways in which Black
               voters react to Black female candidates based on appearance. They
               base their argument, in part, on focus groups with Black women
               candidates and elected officials, and show that there are
               generational differences that determine what sorts of styles
               Black women choose to adopt and to what extent they change their
               physical appearance based on external expectations.",

               illuminating excursion into the situation of persons who are
               unable to conform to standards that society calls normal.
               Disqualified from full social acceptance, they are stigmatized
               individuals. Physically deformed people, ex-mental patients, drug

               rejection of others, and the complex sorts of information about
               themselves they project. In Stigma the interplay of alternatives

               feminism was one of the most significant political and cultural
               developments of the 1960s and 1970s. Yet the role radical
               feminism played within the women's movement remains hotly
               contested. For some, radical feminism has made a lasting
               contribution to our understanding of male privilege, and the ways
               the power imbalance between men and women affects the everyday
               fabric of women's lives. For others, radical feminism represents
               a reflexive hostility toward men, sex, and heterosexuality, and
               thus is best ignored or forgotten. Rather than have the movement
               be interpreted by others, Radical Feminism permits the original
               work of radical feminists to speak for itself. Comprised of
               pivotal documents written by U.S. radical feminists in the 1960s

               radical feminism. Consisting of documents unavailable to the

               this panoramic collection is organized around the key issues of
               sex and sexuality, race, children, lesbianism, separatism, and

               issues.Using an impressive array of evidence from national
               surveys, The Politics of Belonging illuminates patterns of public
               opinion on immigration and explains why Americans hold the
               attitudes they do. Rather than simply characterizing Americans as
               either nativist or nonnativist, this book argues that
               controversies over immigration policy are best understood as
               questions over political membership and belonging to the nation.
               The relationship between citizenship, race, and immigration drive
               the politics of belonging in the United States and represents a
               dynamism central to understanding patterns of contemporary public
               opinion on immigration policy. Beginning with a historical
               analysis, this book documents why this is the case by tracing the
               development of immigration and naturalization law, institutional
               practices, and the formation of the American racial hierarchy.
               Then, through a comparative analysis of public opinion among
               white, black, Latino, and Asian Americans, it identifies and
               tests the critical moderating role of racial categorization and
               group identity on variation in public opinion on immigration.",

               their effects on the mental health of incarcerated people, but
               few studies have examined whether mental health status exposes
               individuals to harsh treatment in the penal system. With
               prisoners confined to their cells for up to 23 hours each day,
               often being denied visitors or phone calls, solitary confinement
               is an important case for studying harsh treatment in prisons.
               Routinely used as punishment for prison infractions, solitary
               confinement may be subject to the same forces that criminalize
               the mentally ill in community settings. Analyzing a large
               administrative data set showing admissions to solitary
               confinement in state prison, we find high rates of punitive
               isolation among those with serious mental illness. Disparities by
               mental health status result from the cumulative effects of prison
               misconduct charges and disciplinary hearings. We estimate that

               solitary confinement than similar incarcerated people with no

               dangerousness follows people into prison, and the criminalization
               of mental illness accompanies greater severity of incarceration.",

               Scott Walker was elected Governor of Wisconsin, the state became
               the focus of debate about the appropriate role of government. In
               a time of rising inequality, Walker not only survived a bitterly
               contested recall, he was subsequently reelected. But why were the
               very people who would benefit from strong government services so
               vehemently against the idea of big government?With The Politics
               of Resentment, Katherine J. Cramer uncovers an oft-overlooked
               piece of the puzzle: rural political consciousness and the
               resentment of the “liberal elite.” Rural voters are distrustful
               that politicians will respect the distinct values of their
               communities and allocate a fair share of resources. What can look
               like disagreements about basic political principles are therefore
               actually rooted in something even more fundamental: who we are as
               people and how closely a candidate’s social identity matches our
               own. Taking a deep dive into Wisconsin’s political climate,
               Cramer illuminates the contours of rural consciousness, showing
               how place-based identities profoundly influence how people
               understand politics. The Politics of Resentment shows that rural

  abstract = "Much of science is concerned with causal inference, namely
              estimating the effect of a “treatment”on an “outcome”. For that
              purpose, a gold-standard method is to run a randomized
              experiment,where units’ exposure to treatment is determined
              randomly. Then, one can compare the averageoutcome of treated and
              untreated units, to unbiasedly estimate the so-called average
              treatmenteffect (ATE), namely the average effect of the treatment
              in the population of interest.In the social sciences and in
              epidemiology, there are many questions which, to date, have
              neverbeen studied using a randomized experiment. For instance, one
              cannot randomly assign individ-uals to a “smoking” treatment
              group, to ascertain that smoking causes lung cancer.
              Similarly,labor economists are interested in the effect of the
              minimum wage on employment, but therehas never been an experiment
              where some firms are randomly assigned to a
              high-minimum-wagegroup. Even if such an experiment had been run,
              its estimate of the minimum wage’s effectwould suffer from an
              important shortcoming. Research ethics require enlightened consent
              toinclude subjects in an experiment, so experimental samples are
              usually not representative ofthe population of interest. Then, the
              hypothetical minimum wage experiment would unbiasedlyestimate the
              minimum wage’s effect among firms that enrolled in the experiment,
              but that effectwould probably differ from the minimum wage’s
              effect among all firms. Firms willing to enrollin an experiment
              that could mandate them to pay a higher minimum wage probably do
              not paymany of their employees at the minimum wage, so a minimum
              wage increase may be less con-sequential to them than to other
              firms. In a nutshell, even when they are feasible,
              randomizedexperiments sometimes lack “external validity”: their
              findings may not be extrapolated from theexperimental sample to
              the population whose ATE the researcher would like to learn.When
              randomized experiments are unfeasible, or when they would lack
              external validity, re-searchers rely on natural experiments to
              estimate treatment effects. Natural experiments usedin the social
              sciences are often policy changes. For instance, a US state
              increases its minimumwage while the neighboring state does not,
              thus giving researchers a treatment group facing ahigh minimum
              wage, and a control group facing a lower minimum wage. Natural
              experimentsoften affect an entire state, region, or province, so
              findings from studies leveraging natural ex-periments typically
              apply to large and unselected populations, unlike findings from
              randomizedexperiments. However, in natural experiments, assignment
              to the treatment is not randomizedby a researcher, it is decided
              by a policy maker. In a sharp reversal of Keynes’ famous
              quote,modern applied researchers, who believe themselves to be
              quite exempt from any practical in-fluences, have to hope that
              practical men will give them good natural experiments they canwork
              with. This fact has two important consequences. First, as policy
              makers do not randomlychoose where to implement a policy change,
              treated and control locations may not be compa-rable, and a simple
              comparison of their mean outcome may not yield an unbiased
              estimator ofthe ATE. In the minimum wage example, the treated and
              control states may for instance havedifferent employment levels
              even before the treated state increased its minimum wage.
              Then,comparing their employment levels after that increase would
              capture the minimum wage’s effectand pre-existing differences
              between the two states. Second, legislative changes are often full
              oftwists and turns. In the minimum wage example, treated states
              that raise their minimum wagemay then decrease it, or increase it
              again. And control states that initially did not change
              theirminimum wage may then decide to change it. Also, some states
              could implement large minimumwage increases, while other states
              implement smaller increases. This creates lots of
              treatmentvariation, that complicates the analysis and can even
              preclude researchers from estimating theclean and simple effects
              they were initially after. Glass-half-empty researchers may lament
              overpolicy makers’ erratic behavior, and wait till they deliver
              the perfect experiment to estimate theparameters that live in
              their models. Glass-half-full researchers will try to learn the
              most fromwhat they have. This book hopes to become a companion for
              glass-half-full researchers, whocourageously try to analyze
              non-randomized, potentially complex natural experiments.",

               even actively consent to the demands of governments, well beyond
               the point explicable by coercion. This is a puzzle for social
               scientists, particularly those who believe that individuals are
               self-interested, rational actors who calculate only the private
               egoistic costs and benefits of possible choices. The provisions
               of collective good should never justify a quasi-voluntary tax
               payment and the benefits of a war could not possibly exceed the
               cost of dying. This book explains the institutionalization of
               policy in response to anticipated and actual citizen behaviour
               and the conditions under which citizens give, refuse and withdraw
               their consent. Professor Levi claims that citizens' consent is
               contingent upon the perceived fairness of both the government and
               of other citizens. Most citizens of democracies, most of the
               time, are more likely to give their consent if they believe that
               government actors and other citizens are behaving fairly toward
               them.",

               for access and the maturation of the internet to allow
               international delivery to meet this demand. This is an opinion
               piece. The cost of basic knowledge assets, with the rise of “big
               data” and the internet, are asymptotically approaching zero,
               questioning why the increasing demand for access cannot be met at

               Louisiana, kidnapped Henderson Lee, a black man charged with
               larceny, and hanged him. Events like this occurred thousands of
               times across the American South in the late nineteenth and early
               twentieth centuries, yet we know scarcely more about any of these
               other victims than we do about Henderson Lee. Drawing on new
               sources to provide the most comprehensive portrait of the men and
               women lynched in the American South, Amy Bailey and Stewart
               Tolnay’s revealing profiles and careful analysis begin to restore
               the identities of—and lend dignity to—hundreds of lynching
               victims about whom we have known little more than their names and
               alleged offenses. Comparing victims’ characteristics to those of
               African American men who were not lynched, Bailey and Tolnay
               identify the factors that made them more vulnerable to being
               targeted by mobs, including how old they were; what work they
               did; their marital status, place of birth, and literacy; and
               whether they lived in the margins of their communities or
               possessed higher social status. Assessing these factors in the
               context of current scholarship on mob violence and reports on the
               little-studied women and white men who were murdered in similar
               circumstances, this monumental work brings unprecedented clarity

  pages    = "235--280",
  abstract = "It is widely known that the United States has the highest
              incarceration rate in the developed world, and the causes and
              ramifications of mass incarceration are the subject of intense
              study. It is also increasingly widely recognized that the high
              rates of pretrial detention, often linked to the use of money
              bail, are unjust, expensive, and often counterproductive. But, so
              far, the links between money bail, pretrial detention, and mass
              incarceration have been largely unexplored. Our criminal justice
              system relies primarily on plea bargains to secure convictions at
              a relatively low cost. And, as shown by recent empirical work, the
              bail system, which results in high pretrial detention rates for
              indigent defendants, plays a significant role in incentivizing
              quick pleas, and leads to more convictions and longer sentences.
              Releasing more defendants pretrial would generate more pretrial
              motions, lengthier plea negotiations, and more trials, and would
              thus raise the cost--in the form of prosecutors, public defenders,
              and judges--of convictions and imprisonment. In other words, if we
              release significantly more defendants pretrial, we will have to
              either spend more on criminal justice or convict fewer people and
              punish them less severely. In addition to inducing quick,
              inexpensive guilty pleas from defendants unable to post bond,
              money bail also plays a more subtle role in sustaining high
              incarceration rates. Money bail, by its very nature, discriminates
              based on wealth, and thus provides a built-in sorting
              mechanism--politically weak lowincome defendants are pushed into
              the quick-plea process, while wealthier defendants are able to
              obtain release and the increased access to more robust process
              that it affords. If politically better-represented wealthy and
              middle-class defendants were detained, and thus subjected to at
              least some of the same pressures to plead guilty as indigent
              defendants, there would, in all likelihood, be more demand for
              reform. This Article explores the role of bail in mass
              incarceration, concluding that opponents of mass incarceration
              should pay increased attention to the pretrial process as a locus
              of reform. Relatedly, it analyzes the likely impact of the
              bail-plea bargain link on future bail reform--which, of course,
              serves important interests beyond reducing the prison population,
              such as fairness and the avoidance of wrongful convictions.

               likely to succeed than those that use violence. We argue that how
               protest tactics are perceived is not a purely objective
               determination, but can be influenced in part by observer
               characteristics–in particular, by partisan identity. We conducted
               a survey experiment on two independent samples through the MTurk
               platform, randomly assigning protester group identity and
               tactics. Results show that when controlling for assigned tactics,
               self-identified Republicans but not Democrats perceive higher
               levels of violence when a disliked group is protesting. The
               effect is strongest in regard to tactics that are nominally the
               least disruptive. The findings have implications for theories of
               nonviolent protest, the legitimacy of repression, and the
               prospects for marginal groups to influence policy in polarized
               societies.",

  abstract  = "Previous studies have established that people encode the race of
               each individual they encounter, and do so via computational
               processes that appear to be both automatic and mandatory. If
               true, this conclusion would be important, because categorizing
               others by their race is a precondition for treating them
               differently according to race. Here we report experiments, using
               unobtrusive measures, showing that categorizing individuals by
               race is not inevitable, and supporting an alternative hypothesis:
               that encoding by race is instead a reversible byproduct of
               cognitive machinery that evolved to detect coalitional alliances.
               The results show that subjects encode coalitional affiliations as
               a normal part of person representation. More importantly, when
               cues of coalitional affiliation no longer track or correspond to
               race, subjects markedly reduce the extent to which they
               categorize others by race, and indeed may cease doing so
               entirely. Despite a lifetime's experience of race as a predictor
               of social alliance, less than 4 min of exposure to an alternate
               social world was enough to deflate the tendency to categorize by
               race. These results suggest that racism may be a volatile and
               eradicable construct that persists only so long as it is actively
               maintained through being linked to parallel systems of social
               alliance.",

               behavior. We will show that, in order to understand the influence
               of attitudes on behavior, we must distinguish between two types
               of attitude. The first type are general attitudes toward physical
               objects (Yosemite National Park, the Empire State Building);
               racial, ethnic, or other groups (African Americans, Jews, gays);
               institutions (Congress, the Catholic Church); policies (gun
               control, tax cuts); events (September 11, the World Series); or
               other general targets. The second type are attitudes toward
               performing specific behaviors with respect to an object or target
               (visiting Yosemite National Park, hiring an African American,
               etc.). These attitudes will be referred to as attitudes toward a
               behavior. A parallel distinction will be made between broad
               behavioral categories or multiple-act aggregates and single
               behaviors. We first consider the problems and issues involved in
               relating general and behavior-specific attitudes to multiple-act
               aggregates and to single behaviors. Our discussion of the
               determinants of specific behaviors is guided largely by a
               reasoned action approach that assumes that people's behavior
               follows reasonably from their beliefs, attitudes, and intentions.
               We focus on this causal analysis because a great deal of
               contemporary research concerning the influence of attitudes on
               behavior is conducted within this conceptual framework. We
               recognize the possibility that influence can also flow from
               attitudes and behaviors to beliefs, but these topics are covered
               in other chapters of this volume. Similarly, the effect of
               attitude change on changes in behavior is not a major focus
               because it is discussed elsewhere in this volume. (PsycInfo

              exert this effect by altering not only the capacities, interests,

               They are abstract concepts, often difficult to define and grasp.
               Thus throughout the history of Western society, the head and the
               heart, concrete and identifiable elements, have been used as
               symbols of rationality and emotion. Drawing on the conceptual
               metaphor framework, we propose that people understand the
               abstract concepts of rationality and emotion using knowledge of a
               more concrete concept-the vertical difference between the head
               and heart. In six studies, we show a deep-seated conceptual
               metaphorical relationship linking rationality with ``up'' or
               ``higher'' and emotion with ``down'' or ``lower.'' We show that
               the association between verticality and rationality/emotion
               affects how consumers perceive information and thereby has
               downstream consequences on attitudes and preferences. We find the
               association to be most influential when consumers are unaware of
               it and when it applies to an unfamiliar stimulus. Because all
               visual formats-from the printed page to screens on a television,
               computer, or smartphone-entail a vertical placement, this
               association has important managerial implications. Our studies

               the broader political process. This evolution has entailed

               focused on the 2016 presidential election. We ran an experiment

               epistemic view of politics in which the ultimate determinants of
               political action are ideas about the society in which we act.
               These ideas are usually mediated to us by others, so Zaller
               begins the book by describing its topic as the influence of the
               media on public opinion, and he includes journalists among the
               ``political elites'' who exert this influence (along with
               politicians, public officials, and experts). But the book
               eventually reduces journalists to being messengers of
               politicians' cues to the public. This understanding of the media
               is built into the book's model of opinion formation, in which
               cued predispositions are pivotal to the acceptance or rejection
               of culturally mediated ``messages''-but are themselves insulated
               from cultural influence. A cueing model of message reception,
               however, ignores messages that are differentially persuasive not
               because of the predispositions they cue but the content they
               convey. Gauging the heterogeneous persuasiveness of messages
               requires qualitative content analysis and cultural
               contextualization, and if this research is to contribute to a
               general understanding of public opinion, it will have to extend
               beyond news-media messages to ideational influences carried in
               high culture, formal education, and the entertainment media. All
               of these sources of ideas, in turn, may contribute to the shaping
               of predispositions, as suggested in part by public opinion
               regarding the Vietnam War. Research of this kind would signal a
               new type of political science that focused on the actual thoughts
               of real people trying to understand a complex environment:

               science's dual embrace of common sense and the aesthetic. James

               That is, once people have received information from political
               elites, they tend to abide by whatever their respective
               cue-givers dictate, since rejecting information is more
               cognitively costly than simply accepting it. Empirical research
               in psychology on priming supports this view of the citizen as a
               passive receiver of information. For example, people are likely
               to be unconsciously influenced by subtle cues and they tend to
               base their opinions on the accessibility of information in
               memory. However, some citizens, under certain conditions, may be
               ``active processors'' of information: actively interpreting it,
               elaborating on its implications, and negotiating its meaning.
               Whether or not Zaller's model is an accurate representation of
               the process of public-opinion formation depends substantially
               upon the inclusiveness of the researcher's views about what

               with an attitude object would tend to produce more affective
               reactions than indirect experience with the object and,
               alternatively, that indirect experience would produce more

               test this, participants were given either a direct or an indirect
               experience with a set of puzzles and then required to indicate
               their reactions to the puzzles. As predicted, direct experience
               produced more affective reactions and indirect experience
               produced more cognitive reactions. In Study 2, we hypothesized
               that attitudes produced after direct experience would predict
               consummatory behavior better than instrumental behavior and that
               attitudes produced after indirect experience would do the
               opposite. Again the results supported the hypothesis. In Study 3,
               we hypothesized that attitude accessibility mediates the
               relationships found in Study 2. That is, in a consummatory
               situation attitudes formed through direct experience are more
               assessable that attitudes formed through indirect experience. The

              feelings. For example, when trying to gauge how much someone else
              enjoys a television show, people might think ``How much do I enjoy
              it?'' and use this answer as basis for estimating others'
              reactions. Although personal experience (such as actually watching
              the show oneself) often improves empathic accuracy, we found that
              gaining too much experience can impair it. Five experiments
              highlight a desensitization bias in emotional perspective taking,
              with consequences for social prediction, social judgment, and
              social behavior. Participants who viewed thrilling or shocking
              images many times predicted first-time viewers would react less
              intensely (Experiments 1 and 2); participants who heard the same
              funny joke or annoying noise many times estimated less intense
              reactions of first-time listeners (Experiments 3 and 4); and
              further, participants were less likely to actually share good
              jokes and felt less bad about blasting others with annoying noise
              after they themselves became desensitized to those events
              (Experiments 3-5). These effects were mediated by participants'
              own attenuated reactions. Moreover, observers failed to anticipate
              this bias, believing that overexposed participants (i.e.,
              repeatedly exposed participants who became desensitized) would
              make better decisions on their behalf (Experiment 5). Taken
              together, these findings reveal a novel paradox in emotional
              perspective taking: If people experience an evocative event many
              times, they may not become wiser companions but worse, unable to
              disentangle self-change from other-oriented thinking. Just as
              lacking exposure to others' experiences can create gaps in empathy
              and understanding, so may gaining too much. © 2014 American

               exclusively on the out-group attitudes whites possess toward
               racial and ethnic minorities. Work in social psychology, however,
               suggests that intergroup attitudes are usually comprised of both
               an out-group and an in-group component. Nevertheless, political
               scientists have tended to overlook or dismiss the possibility
               that whites’ in-group attitudes are associated with political
               evaluations. Changing demographic patterns, immigration, the
               historic election of Obama, and new candidate efforts to appeal
               to whites as a collective group suggest a need to reconsider the
               full nature and consequences of the racial attitudes that may
               influence whites’ electoral preferences. This study, therefore,
               examines the extent to which both white out-group racial
               resentment and white in-group racial identity matter in
               contemporary electoral politics. Comparing the factors associated
               with vote choice in 2012 and 2016, and candidate evaluations in
               2018, this study finds that both attitudes were powerfully
               associated with candidate evaluations in 2012 and early 2016,
               although white out-group attitudes overshadowed the electoral
               impact of in-group racial attitudes by the 2016 general election.
               The results suggest that there are now two independent racial
               attitudes tied to whites’ political preferences in the
               contemporary U.S., and understanding the dynamics of white racial
               animus and white racial identity across electoral contexts
               continues to be an important avenue for future work.",

               indicates that African Americans do face significant barriers to
               winning White votes, initial interpretations of the 2008 election
               results suggest that the Obama vote was not depressed because of
               his race. In this paper, I introduce a relatively unobtrusive
               measure of racial salience to examine whether these initial
               interpretations are correct. I find that when race was a more
               salient factor for White voters, they were substantially less
               likely to vote for Obama and were more likely to think that Obama
               was focusing attention on African Americans during the campaign.
               I estimate that the salience of race for some Whites may have
               cost Obama as much as 3\% of the White vote. Thus, this paper
               indicates that even in Obama's historic 2008 campaign, African

               and operationalization-is poorly predicted by emotions associated
               with information seeking (e.g., fear), while it is better
               structured by emotions associated with expression and
               participation (e.g., enthusiasm). Second, leveraging available
               temporal information, we find evidence that, although only
               suggestive, is consistent with emotion leading to disagreeable
               discussion (rather than disagreement leading to emotion). We

               vote cannot be explained by a lack of trust in politics or low
               levels of satisfaction with democracy, as would be assumed given
               the extant literature on protest voting. However, indicators of
               racist resentment and anti-immigrant sentiments proved to be
               important determinants of a Trump vote-even when controlling for
               more traditional vote-choice determinants. Despite ongoing
               discussion about the empirical validity of racist resentment and
               anti-immigrant sentiments, both concepts proved to be roughly
               equally powerful in explaining a Trump vote.",

               preferences in data from the Multi-Ethnic Module of the 2000

               been accompanied by substantial increases in rates of interracial

               Explanations for the retreat from marriage among Black women have
               focused on deficits in the quantity and quality of available
               partners, and the role of racial intermarriage largely has been
               ignored. This study examines the impact of interracial marriage
               by Black men on the marriage prospects of Black women. First, our
               analysis of data from the 1990 Integrated Public Use Microdata
               Series (IPUMS) reveals that intermarried Black men are selective
               of those with the highest levels of education, income, and
               occupational prestige. Second, multilevel analyses, using both
               the IPUMS and Panel Study of Income Dynamics, show that the level
               of intermarriage in metropolitan areas is significantly related
               to the marital behaviors of Black women. Local rates of
               intermarriage among Black men reduce the likelihood that Black
               women currently will be married and that they will make the
               transition to marriage. These effects are especially acute for
               highly educated Black women whose marriage markets are defined by
               those Black men who are most likely to intermarry. Finally, our
               analyses indicate that intermarriage affects the marital
               prospects of Black women by negatively affecting the pool of
               economically attractive marriage partners in the metropolitan
               area.",

               The current study investigated how individuals' sentiments toward

              scientific domains, it has already experienced three distinct
              stages of development. In the first era (1930-1960), the founders
              of the field invented the basic components of the design of data
              collection and the tools to produce the statistical information
              from surveys. As they were inventing the method, they were also
              building the institutions that conduct surveys in the private,
              academic, and government sectors. The second era (1960-1990)
              witnessed a vast growth in the use of the survey method. This
              growth was aided by the needs of the U.S. federal government to
              monitor the effects of investments in human and physical
              infrastructure, the growth of the quantitative social sciences,
              and the use of quantitative information to study consumer
              behaviors. The third era (1990 and forward) witnessed the declines
              in survey participation rates, the growth of alternative modes of
              data collection, the weakening of sampling frames, and the growth
              of continuously produced process data from digital systems in all
              sectors, but especially those emanating from the Internet.
              Throughout each era, survey research methods adapted to changes in
              society and exploited new technologies when they proved valuable

              entering the statistical paradises created by Big Data. By
              developing measures for data quality, this article suggests a
              framework to address such a question: ``Which one should I trust
              more: a 1\% survey with 60\% response rate or a self-reported
              administrative dataset covering 80\% of the population?'' A
              5-element Euler-formula-like identity shows that for any dataset
              of size n, probabilistic or not, the difference between the sample
              average X n and the population average X N is the product of three
              terms: (1) a data quality measure, ρ R,X , the correlation between
              X j and the response/recording indicator R j ; (2) a data quantity
              measure, √ (N − n)/n, where N is the population size; and (3) a
              problem difficulty measure, σ X , the standard deviation of X.
              This decomposition provides multiple insights: (I) Probabilistic
              sampling ensures high data quality by controlling ρ R,X at the
              level of N −1/2 ; (II) When we lose this control , the impact of N
              is no longer canceled by ρ R,X , leading to a Law of Large
              Populations (LLP), that is, our estimation error, relative to the
              benchmarking rate 1/ √ n, increases with √ N; and (III) the
              ``bigness'' of such Big Data (for population inferences) should be
              measured by the relative size f = n/N , not the absolute size n;
              (IV) When combining data sources for population inferences , those
              relatively tiny but higher quality ones should be given far more
              weights than suggested by their sizes. Estimates obtained from the
              Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the 2016 US
              presidential election suggest a ρ R,X ≈ −0.005 for self-reporting
              to vote for Donald Trump. Because of LLP, this seemingly minuscule
              data defect correlation implies that the simple sample proportion
              of the self-reported voting preference for Trump from 1\% of the
              US eligible voters, that is, n ≈ 2,300,000, has the same mean
              squared error as the corresponding sample proportion from a
              genuine simple random sample of size n ≈ 400, a 99.98\% reduction

              of public opinion from the late 1980s in a top-down model of
              opinion formation and change. The core feature of this synthesis,
              the Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) model, remains sound, but the book
              overstates the importance of the form of public opinion that it
              explains-elite-induced survey statements of issue positions-and
              understates the force of opinions that elites cannot easily shape
              and that citizens may not be able to articulate in response to
              survey prompts. Moreover, there are major problems in the book's
              Parable of Purple Land. What, then, becomes of the top-down view
              of elite-mass interaction outlined in Nature and Origins? To
              answer this question, I begin by characterizing the kinds of
              opinions Nature and Origins leaves out: Converse's ``group
              interest'' voters, ``nature of the times'' voters, and issue
              publics. I then add a model of political parties as
              policy-motivated organizers of Converse's voter types. The upshot
              is an account of elite/mass interactions that is still largely
              top-down and that has roles for both the elite-led attitudes that
              the RAS model explains and the less conventional and
              harder-to-shape attitudes that it overlooks. © 2012 Copyright

               as partisans correctly updated economic beliefs to reflect new

               selective fashion. Although partisans might acknowledge the same

              organizations (CSOs) moderate the negative effects of involuntary
              criminal justice contact on political participation, particularly
              political activism beyond registering to vote and voting. We test
              this proposition with individual-level and aggregate-level data
              from metropolitan and municipal Chicago. Our findings confirm a
              paradox of participation by custodial citizens. One, we
              demonstrate positive, statistically significant, and substantive
              effects of personal connections to CSOs on nonvoting political
              participation by custodial citizens. Two, the negative effects of
              involuntary criminal justice contact on voting participation among
              individuals and communities may endure, despite personal
              connections to CSOs, even in a state where the franchise is
              restored immediately after incarceration. Our study suggests that
              an associational account of political participation deepens our
              understanding of the political behavior of custodial citizens and
              their communities in the age of mass incarceration.",

              downward adjustment of an existing evaluation. However, recent
              studies show exactly the opposite; voters become more supportive
              of a preferred candidate in the face of negatively valenced
              information. Motivated reasoning is advanced as the explanation,
              arguing that people are psychologically motivated to maintain and
              support existing evaluations. Yet it seems unlikely that voters do
              this ad infinitum. To do so would suggest continued motivated
              reasoning even in the face of extensive disconfirming information.
              In this study we consider whether motivated reasoning processes
              can be overcome simply by continuing to encounter information
              incongruent with expectations. If so, voters must reach a tipping

               endorsement by the World Health Assembly, including 11 goals to
               eradicate or eliminate diseases. 2 This indicator counts more

               permission to go ahead with our indicator at its second meeting

               the pledge to `` leave no one behind '' . 4 But the inclusion of

               analysis to provide robust estimates of the effects of
               independent variables, but some research argues that using LDVs
               in regressions produces negatively biased coefficient estimates,
               even if the LDV is part of the data-generating process. I
               demonstrate that these concerns are easily resolved by specifying
               a regression model that accounts for autocorrelation in the error
               term. This actually implies that more LDV and lagged independent
               variables should be included in the specification, not fewer.
               Including the additional lags yields more accurate parameter
               estimates, which I demonstrate using the same data-generating
               process scholars had previously used to argue against including
               LDVs. I use Monte Carlo simulations to show that this
               specification returns much more accurate coefficient estimates
               for independent variables (across a wide range of parameter
               values) than alternatives considered in earlier research. The
               simulation results also indicate that improper exclusion of LDVs
               can lead to severe bias in coefficient estimates. While no
               panacea, scholars should continue to confidently include LDVs as
               part of a robust estimation strategy.",

               society. Our results indicate that changes in marital
               assimilation have taken on momentum of their own; that is,
               America's growing biracial population has fueled the growth of
               interracial marriages with whites. Analyses also shed new light
               on the effects of rapid immigration, rising cohabitation, and
               educational upgrading on intermarriage patterns, and yield both
               continuities and departures from the past. Historic patterns of
               racial/ethnic differences in intermarriage persist—Hispanics and
               American Indians are most likely to marry whites, followed
               closely by Asian Americans. African Americans are least likely to
               marry whites. Yet, the 1990s brought significant increases in
               intermarriage between blacks and whites; large increases in
               cohabitation did not offset the growth of racially-mixed

               American-white marriages among the highly educated African

               shifting, blurring, or crossing of racial/ethnic boundaries

              Americans. Their discoveries will surprise pollsters and
              policymakers alike. The authors show that prejudice, although by
              no means gone, has lost its power to dominate the political
              thinking of white Americans. Concentrating on the new
              race-conscious agenda, they introduce a method of hidden
              measurement which reveals that liberals are just as angry over
              affirmative action as conservatives and that racial prejudice,
              while more common among conservatives, is more powerful in shaping
              the political thinking of liberals. They also find that the good
              will many whites express for blacks is not feigned but represents
              a genuine regard for blacks, which they will stand by even when
              given a perfectly acceptable excuse to respond negatively to
              blacks. More crucially, Sniderman and Carmines show that the
              current impasse over race can be overcome if we remember what we
              once knew. The strongest arguments in behalf of equality for black
              Americans reach beyond race to the moral principles that give the
              issue of race itself a moral claim on us.",

               or information shortcuts when making their decisions of whom to
               support. While existing research on these shortcuts has examined
               many candidate characteristics, it has largely overlooked the
               potential of candidate occupational cues. This article uses
               experimental survey data conducted by the Los Angeles Times Poll
               in the 1994 statewide elections in California to analyze whether
               candidates' occupational ballot designations influence voters'
               choices. Specifically, it hypothesizes that voters use candidate
               occupational labels to infer candidates' competence or
               qualifications for the office in question. As the analysis
               demonstrates, candidate occupational cues have two simultaneous
               effects on voting behavior: they help voters make a decision in
               races where they otherwise might not have, decreasing abstention;
               and in races in which voters infer one candidate to have a
               qualification advantage, the addition of occupational
               designations makes voters more likely to support that candidate.

               experiments. While experimental research designs have contributed
               much to the analysis of political stereotypes and heuristics, the
               extent to which experi- mental research on this hypothesis is
               externally valid is open to question. Moreover, experimental
               approaches are notwell-suited to estimating the magnitude of the
               effects of stereotypes in real-world situations, especially in
               the context of complex political phe- nomena such as election
               campaigns. In this article, I develop a statistical model of the

               estimate the model using data on incumbent candidates from the

               candidates. In contrast, the perceptions of black respondents are

              low scores? The essay sheds light on this intriguing puzzle by
              showing that current tests of voter knowledge, which focus on rote
              memorization of names and factual details, underrate voters'
              election IQ. Moreover, knowledge scores could rise sharply if the

              voter's information needs. Major problems in the election
              information supply are an overemphasis on isolated facts and
              inappropriate message framing when it comes to the substance and
              format of news stories. Furthermore, many election stories are
              repetitive and uninteresting to voters. The general public's
              response to the “new” media presentations, which became popular
              during the 1992 presidential campaign, shows that it is possible
              to make election news more attractive and informative for today's

               effect in which people see bias in balanced reporting on
               political controversies. In the contemporary fragmented media
               environment, partisan news outlets intentionally report political
               news from ideological perspectives, raising the possibility that
               ideologically biased news may cause viewers to become
               increasingly suspicious of and antagonistic toward news
               media—which we call oppositional media hostility. However, the
               fragmented media environment also gives television viewers ample
               opportunities to tune out news outlets with which they disagree
               as well as the news altogether, and this should moderate
               oppositional media hostility. We investigate the effects of
               partisan news shows on media perceptions across six
               laboratory-based experiments. We find that counterattitudinal
               news programming is more likely to induce hostile media
               perceptions than proattitudinal programming, but that the
               presence of choice blunts oppositional media hostility. We
               explore possible mechanisms that underlie the moderating effects
               of selective exposure. T he widespread availability of cable and
               satellite television, which reaches 91\% of American households
               (TVB 2010), has greatly expanded the news and entertainment
               options available to citizens. As of 2008, the average American
               household could choose from among 119 channels, which is more
               than six times the average number of channels available in 1985
               (Nielsen 2008) and 40 times the number of channels available
               prior to the rise of cable television. This expansion of choice
               has helped bring about the fragmentation of the television news
               media (Prior 2007) and the stratification of cable news networks
               along ideological lines (Coe et al. 2008; Groseclose and Milyo
               2005; Morris 2005; Mullainathan and Shleifer 2005). The

               the communication shapes its persuasiveness. Recent research in
               political communication suggests that important source cues are
               nonverbal and relate to the physical traits of the source such
               that attractive- and competent-looking sources have better
               success in attracting votes and policy support. Yet, are all
               nonverbal source cues similarly received irrespective of
               audience, or does their reception vary across audiences?
               Specifically, we ask whether some physical traits are received
               positively by some audiences but backfire for others. Utilizing
               research on ideological stereotypes and the determinants of
               facial preferences, we focus on the relationship between the
               facial dominance of the source and the ideology of the receiver.
               Across five studies, we demonstrate that a dominant face is a
               winning face when the audience is conservative but backfires and
               decreases success when the audience is liberal. On the other
               hand, a non-dominant face constitutes a winning face among
               liberal audiences but backfires among conservatives. These
               effects seemingly stem from deep-seated psychological responses
               and shape both the election and communication success of
               real-world politicians. If the faces of politicians do not match
               the ideology of their constituency, they are more likely to lose
               in the competition for votes and policy support.",

               that democratic leaders, when faced with war, are more inclined
               to shift extra resources into the war effort than are autocrats.
               This follows because the survival of political leaders with
               larger winning coalitions hinges on successful policy. The extra
               effort made by democrats provides a military advantage over
               autocrats. This makes democrats unattractive targets, since their
               institutional constraints cause them to mobilize resources for
               the war effort. In addition to trying harder, democrats are more
               selective in their choice of targets. Because defeat is more
               likely to lead to domestic replacement for democrats than for
               autocrats, democrats only initiate wars they expect to win. These

              general medicine outpatient clinic at a rural tertiary care center
              associated with a medical school. PATIENTS: 470 of 511 consecutive
              patients who agreed to answer a questionnaire while waiting for
              their clinic visit. Mean age was 49.1 years, 62.1\% were female,
              and 51.9\% had at least one year of education beyond high school.
              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient response to the choice of two
              equally efficacious medications for the management of a
              hypothetical serious disease. The benefit of one medication was
              stated in relative terms, the other in absolute terms. Patients
              could choose either medication alone, indicate indifference to the
              choice of medication, or choose not to answer. MAIN RESULTS:
              56.8\% of the patients chose the medication whose benefit was in
              relative terms. 14.7\% chose the medication whose benefit was in
              absolute terms. Only 15.5\% were indifferent to the choice of
              medication. The patients preferred the medication whose benefit
              was in relative terms across a wide range of ages and educational
              levels. Further questioning suggested that the patients thought
              benefit was greater when expressed in relative terms because they
              ignored the underlying risk of disease and assumed it was one.
              CONCLUSIONS: The ``framing'' of benefit (or risk) in relative
              versus absolute terms may have a major influence on patient
              preference.",

              seems too good to refuse: ``Appoint me and I will let you in on a
              secret policy-setting strategy that has been shown to increase
              savings rates, save lives by improving voluntary efforts, and
              change how people manage risk.'' Even better, the potential
              appointee adds, ``It costs very little and works even if people do
              nothing. In fact, it depends upon people doing nothing.'' What is
              the secret strategy? The proper setting of no-action defaults.
              Default options are those assigned to people who do not make an
              active decision. For example, in the United States, people are by
              default not organ donors and, until recently, did not contribute
              to their retirement plans. However, when purchasing new
              automobiles, they do receive air bags by default; customers need
              not ask for them. How strong are the effects of defaults on
              choices? Do defaults influence us and why? Drawing on a variety of
              policy domains, we will illustrate the power of default effects
              and explore the possible psychological mechanisms that underlie
              them. With an eye on questions of ethics, obligations, and
              effectiveness, we will evaluate policies that have been proposed
              for setting defaults. Our goal is to move defaults from the chest
              of secret strategies to the library of mechanisms by which
              policies can impact behavior (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016

               for our children to the meals we eat to the causes we champion.
               Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nobel laureate Richard
               Thaler and legal scholar and bestselling author Cass Sunstein
               explain in this important exploration of choice architecture
               that, being human, we all are susceptible to various biases that
               can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less
               healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education,
               personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the
               family, and even the planet itself. In Nudge, Thaler and Sunstein
               invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes our
               humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people think,
               we can design choice environments that make it easier for people
               to choose what is best for themselves, their families, and their
               society. Using colorful examples from the most important aspects
               of life, Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how thoughtful ''choice
               architecture`` can be established to nudge us in beneficial
               directions without restricting freedom of choice. Nudge offers a
               unique new take--from neither the left nor the right--on many
               hot-button issues, for individuals and governments alike. This is

              inequality around the world has led many economists to seriously
              question the model of individual economic self-determination when
              it comes to the poor. In Poverty Traps, Samuel Bowles, Steven
              Durlauf, Karla Hoff, and the book's other contributors argue that
              there are many conditions that may trap individuals, groups, and
              whole economies in intractable poverty. For the first time the
              editors have brought together the perspectives of economics,
              economic history, and sociology to assess what we know--and don't
              know--about such traps. Among the sources of the poverty of
              nations, the authors assign a primary role to social and political
              institutions, ranging from corruption to seemingly benign social
              customs such as kin systems. Many of the institutions that keep
              nations poor have deep roots in colonial history and persist long
              after their initial causes are gone. Neighborhood
              effects--influences such as networks, role models, and
              aspirations--can create hard-to-escape pockets of poverty even in
              rich countries. Similar individuals in dissimilar socioeconomic
              environments develop different preferences and beliefs that can
              transmit poverty or affluence from generation to generation. The
              book presents evidence of harmful neighborhood effects and
              discusses policies to overcome them, with attention to the
              uncertainty that exists in evaluating such policies. (PsycINFO

               the sign says ``LIMIT 12 PER CUSTOMER'' rather than ``LIMIT 4 PER

               imperfections result from a haphazard evolutionary process that
               often proceeds by piling new systems on top of old ones-and those

              And what are the consequences of that process? Like individuals,
              Congress is subject to the “paradox of search.” If policy makers
              don’t look for problems, they won’t find those that need to be
              addressed. But if they carry out a thorough search, they will
              almost certainly find new problems—and with the definition of each
              new problem comes the possibility of creating a government program
              to address it. With The Politics of Attention, leading policy
              scholars Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones demonstrated the
              central role attention plays in how governments prioritize
              problems. Now, with The Politics of Information, they turn the
              focus to the problem-detection process itself, showing how the
              growth or contraction of government is closely related to how it
              searches for information and how, as an organization, it analyzes
              its findings. Better search processes that incorporate more
              diverse viewpoints lead to more intensive policymaking activity.
              Similarly, limiting search processes leads to declines in policy
              making. At the same time, the authors find little evidence that
              the factors usually thought to be responsible for government
              expansion—partisan control, changes in presidential leadership,
              and shifts in public opinion—can be systematically related to the
              patterns they observe. Drawing on data tracing the course of
              American public policy since World War II, Baumgartner and Jones
              once again deepen our understanding of the dynamics of American
              policy making.",

              physicians' perceptions of the factors, attitudes and knowledge
              influencing antibiotic prescription. Of the total of 35 papers
              selected for review purposes, 18 solely included physicians and
              the remaining 17 also included patients and/or other healthcare
              providers. Data collection was based mainly on interviews,

              mainly used for data analysis were grounded theory and thematic

              antibiotic prescribing were grouped into those that were intrinsic
              (group 1) and those that were extrinsic (group 2) to the
              healthcare professional. Among the former, physicians' attitudes,
              such as complacency or fear, were rated as being most influential
              on antibiotic prescribing, whilst patient-related factors (e.g.
              signs and symptoms) or healthcare system-related factors (e.g.
              time pressure and policies/guidelines implemented) were the most
              commonly reported extrinsic factors. These findings revealed that:
              (i) antibiotic prescribing is a complex process influenced by

              other healthcare providers, healthcare system, patients and the
              general public; and (ii) such factors are mutually dependent.

              hopefully contribute to generating new and more effective

               wide range of experimental and field studies reveal that several

               Demographic characteristics of judges and litigants affect
               judges' decisions. Judges also rely heavily on intuitive
               reasoning in deciding cases, making them vulnerable to the use of
               mental shortcuts that can lead to mistakes. Furthermore, judges

               they share demographic characteristics. On the whole, judges are

               judgment that influence ordinary adults. The weight of the

              shifts predicted by the ovulatory shift hypothesis (Gildersleeve,
              Haselton, \& Fales, 2014). However, Wood, Kressel, Joshi, and
              Louie (2014) claimed an absence of compelling support for this
              hypothesis and asserted that the few significant cycle shifts they
              observed were false positives resulting from publication bias,
              p-hacking, or other research artifacts. How could 2 meta-analyses
              of the same literature reach such different conclusions? We
              reanalyzed the data compiled by Wood et al. These analyses
              revealed problems in Wood et al.’s meta-analysis—some of which are
              reproduced in Wood and Carden’s (2014) comment in the current
              issue of this journal—that led them to overlook clear evidence for
              the ovulatory shift hypothesis in their own set of effects. In

              Harris, Pashler, and Mickes (2014) that supportive findings in the
              cycle shift literature are false positives. Therefore, evidence
              from both of the meta-analyses and the p-curves strongly supports
              genuine, robust effects consistent with the ovulatory shift
              hypothesis and contradicts claims that these effects merely
              reflect publication bias, p-hacking, or other research artifacts.
              Unfounded speculations about p-hacking distort the research record
              and risk unfairly damaging researchers’ reputations; they should

               concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally
               select models that yield positive findings, leading to an
               unreliable body of published research. To combat this ``fishing''
               problem in medical studies, leading journals now require
               pre-registration of designs that emphasize the prior
               identification of dependent and independent variables. However,
               we demonstrate here that even with this level of advanced
               specification, the scope for fishing is considerable when there
               is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other
               elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed
               through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We
               experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing
               field experiment for which we drafted a complete ``mock report''
               of findings using fake data on treatment assignment. We describe
               the advantages and disadvantages of this form of registration and
               propose that a comprehensive but nonbinding approach be adopted
               as a first step to combat fishing by social scientists. Likely
               effects of comprehensive but nonbinding registration are
               discussed, the principal advantage being communication rather
               than commitment, in particular that it generates a clear

              variability of results obtained with choices of adjustments called
              the ``vibration of effects'' (VoE). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING We
              estimated the VoE for 417 clinical, environmental, and
              physiological variables in association with all-cause mortality
              using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We
              selected 13 variables as adjustment covariates and computed 8,192
              Cox models for each of 417 variables' associations with all-cause
              mortality. RESULTS We present the VoE by assessing the variance of
              the effect size and in the -log10(P-value) obtained by different
              combinations of adjustments. We present whether there are
              multimodality patterns in effect sizes and P-values and the
              trajectory of results with increasing adjustments. For 31\% of the
              417 variables, we observed a Janus effect, with the effect being
              in opposite direction in the 99th versus the 1st percentile of
              analyses. For example, the vitamin E variant α-tocopherol had a

              Estimating VoE offers empirical estimates of associations are
              under different model specifications. When VoE is large, claims
              for observational associations should be very cautious.",

               signs of success. Yet there are warning signs, too. This paper
               attempts to critically summarize current developments in the
               young field of political methodology. It focuses on recent
               generalizations of dichotomous-dependent-variable estimators such

               replacement therapy reduces the risk of heart disease, then
               reversed themselves and said it increases the risk of heart
               disease. What are the effects caused by consuming alcohol or by
               receiving hormone replacement therapy? These are causal
               questions, questions about the effects caused by treatments,
               policies or preventable exposures. Some causal questions can be
               studied in randomized trials, in which a coin is flipped to

              between resistance and political devolution is typically
              endogenous. To address this issue, we identify a natural
              experiment based on the locally arbitrary assignment of French
              municipalities into German or Vichy-governed zones during World
              War II. Using a regression discontinuity design, we conclude that
              devolving governing authority significantly lowered levels of
              resistance. We argue that this effect is driven by a process of
              political cooptation: domestic groups that were granted governing
              authority were less likely to engage in resistance activity, while
              violent resistance was heightened in regions dominated by groups
              excluded from the governing regime. This finding stands in

               new way of reducing police use of force, as well as assaults
               against officers. To date, only a handful of peer-reviewed

               as an additional outcome. Using a prospective meta-analysis of
               multi-site, multi-national randomised controlled trials from 10
               discrete tests with a total population of +2 million, and 2.2
               million police officer-hours, we assess the effect of BWVs on the
               rates of (i) police use of force and (ii) assaults against
               officers. Averaged over 10 trials, BWVs had no effect on police
               use of force (d = 0.021; SE = 0.056; 95\% CI: –0.089–0.130), but

               against officers, more attention should be paid to how these
               devices are implemented. Likewise, since other public-facing

               (e.g. firefighters, private security, traffic wardens), the

               the adoption of modern technology. The survey also reviews recent

               legitimate and, hence, entitled to be obeyed. Because of this

               proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery
               rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all
               hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in
               problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather
               than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain
               in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved
               to control the false discovery rate for independent test
               statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power
               is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the
               appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.",

  abstract  = "Adopting a unifying theme based on maximum statistics, Multiple
               Comparisons Using R describes the common underlying theory of
               multiple comparison procedures through numerous examples. It also
               presents a detailed description of available software
               implementations in R. The R packages and source code for the
               analyses are available at http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving
               examples of multiplicity problems, the book covers general
               concepts and basic multiple comparisons procedures, including the
               Bonferroni method and Simes’ test. It then shows how to perform
               parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear models and
               general parametric models. It also introduces the multcomp
               package in R, which offers a convenient interface to perform
               multiple comparisons in a general context. Following this
               theoretical framework, the book explores applications involving
               the Dunnett test, Tukey’s all pairwise comparisons, and general
               multiple contrast tests for standard regression models,
               mixed-effects models, and parametric survival models. The last
               chapter reviews other multiple comparison procedures, such as
               resampling-based procedures, methods for group sequential or
               adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple comparison
               procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling multiplicity in
               experiments ensures better decision making and safeguards against
               false claims. A self-contained introduction to multiple
               comparison procedures, this book offers strategies for
               constructing the procedures and illustrates the framework for
               multiple hypotheses testing in general parametric models. It is
               suitable for readers with R experience but limited knowledge of
               multiple comparison procedures and vice versa. See Dr. Bretz
               discuss the book.",

               ingrained, requiring intense intervention to lastingly reduce.
               Here, we show that a single approximately 10-minute conversation
               encouraging actively taking the perspective of others can
               markedly reduce prejudice for at least 3 months. We illustrate
               this potential with a door-to-door canvassing intervention in
               South Florida targeting antitransgender prejudice. Despite
               declines in homophobia, transphobia remains pervasive. For the
               intervention, 56 canvassers went door to door encouraging active
               perspective-taking with 501 voters at voters' doorsteps. A
               randomized trial found that these conversations substantially
               reduced transphobia, with decreases greater than Americans'
               average decrease in homophobia from 1998 to 2012. These effects
               persisted for 3 months, and both transgender and nontransgender
               canvassers were effective. The intervention also increased
               support for a nondiscrimination law, even after exposing voters
               to counterarguments.",

               objective group membership example of social class. Group
               membership vs. group identification (which is broken down into
               social identity and interdependence/common fate). Brewer (among
               others) distinguishes between demographic- and role-based group
               memberships claiming that the latter are not related to
               collective action. Huddy and others disagree, stating that any
               group has the potential to become politicized (example of MADD).
               Political cohesion ``the existence of shared attitudes beliefs,
               and behavior among group members that can be directly attributed
               to group membership.'' o Cognitive approach (Turner, Hogg): Focus
               on self-categorization, want to emulate attitudes and behavior of
               typical group members, perceptions of in/outgroups enhance
               conformity and thus cohesion most pronounced when identity is
               salient. Identities vary because the salience of social
               categories varies across situations constantly switching between
               an individual and a social identity. Cohesion among members of
               any salient group. o Realistic interest approach (Blumer, Bobo):
               Includes realistic group conflict, relative deprivation, and
               social dominance theories. Focuses on how political actions lead
               to group-based gains and losses. Self-interest has been shown to
               have limited effects on preferences, mainly showing up when the
               effect is large, clear, and certain. Cohesion among members who
               share a common fate. o Social identity theory (Tajfel, Turner):
               Focuses on political power of group members' declining status.
               Has split into social identity theory and self-categorization
               theory (precursor to 1). Higher-status groups are more likely to
               be cohesive than lower-status groups due to need for a positive
               group identity. Cohesion among widely stigmatized groups. o
               Social constructivism (Erikson, Huddy): Focuses on the subjective
               meaning of identities (constructed through social processes
               including elite manipulation) and the influence on members'
               political outlooks and actions. Cohesion among members who share
               a common understanding of group membership. Ways to measure
               identity o Felt group closeness problematic because it only
               allows ID with one group, doesn't gauge common fate, and doesn't
               allow for sympathy with groups you don't belong to o Direct
               question asking whether you are a feminist, for example, works
               best if it allows for gradient of 'belonging' o Open-ended
               questions o Group assignment in experimental setting doesn't
               allow for identity strength or move beyond the lab o Multi-item
               scales such as the collective self-esteem (CSE) scale o Implicit
               attitudes Sources of political cohesion o Can be as simple as
               belonging to the same group, even if that group is assigned. o
               Strong, subjective group identity support for policies that
               benefit the group is stronger among strong group identifiers, as
               is animosity toward outgroups and opposition to policies that
               benefit majority outgroups, strong identity is also associated
               with group-related political action and with resistance to
               changes in context. o Shared meaning of group membership meaning
               can come either through social characteristics (image, lifestyle)
               or through common values, political consequences of an identity
               are important (ID with gay movement rather than just with gays or
               AfAm linked with other groups vs. not) o Common fate realistic
               concerns: fraternal deprivation, strongest effects among those
               with strong group ID, awareness grievances and collective
               identity has a bi-directional relationship symbolic concerns:
               group status, highest cohesion when status is viewed as unfair
               Development of group identity o Salient identity People draw on
               identities that are salient at the time, minority group status is
               correlated with salience o Meaning and valence of identity
               defined by social characteristics, values, and valence (more ID
               with higher-status group, but stronger ID with lower-status
               groups if they perceive prejudice against them interactive effect

  pages     =  511,
  abstract  = "In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in behavioral
               research on a wide variety of topics, from behavioral finance,
               labor contracts, philanthropy, and the analysis of savings and
               poverty, to eyewitness identification and sentencing decisions,
               racism, sexism, health behaviors, and voting. Research findings
               have often been strikingly counterintuitive, with serious
               implications for public policymaking. In this book, leading
               experts in psychology, decision research, policy analysis,
               economics, political science, law, medicine, and philosophy
               explore major trends, principles, and general insights about
               human behavior in policy-relevant settings. Their work provides a
               deeper understanding of the many drivers--cognitive, social,
               perceptual, motivational, and emotional--that guide behaviors in
               everyday settings. They give depth and insight into the methods
               of behavioral research, and highlight how this knowledge might
               influence the implementation of public policy for the improvement
               of society. This collection examines the policy relevance of
               behavioral science to our social and political lives, to issues
               ranging from health, environment, and nutrition, to dispute
               resolution, implicit racism, and false convictions. The book
               illuminates the relationship between behavioral findings and
               economic analyses, and calls attention to what policymakers might
               learn from this vast body of groundbreaking work. Wide-ranging
               investigation into people's motivations, abilities, attitudes,
               and perceptions finds that they differ in profound ways from what
               is typically assumed. The result is that public policy acquires
               even greater significance, since rather than merely facilitating
               the conduct of human affairs, policy actually shapes their
               trajectory. The first interdisciplinary look at behaviorally
               informed policymaking. Leading behavioral experts across the
               social sciences consider important policy problems. A compendium

               better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the
               workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and
               addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to
               maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which
               self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better
               regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding
               self-control is the strength or ‘resource depletion’ model.
               Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource which
               becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting
               self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a
               ‘sequential-task’ experimental paradigm in which people
               completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control
               capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state
               known as ‘ego depletion’. Although a meta-analysis of
               ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent
               meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the
               effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses
               served as a catalyst for the current registered replication
               report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories (k =
               23, total N = 2141) conducted replications of a standardized
               ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by
               Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the
               size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95\% confidence
               intervals that encompassed zero. We discuss implications of the
               findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion
               model of self-control.",

  abstract  = "In political opinion surveys from the 1950s through the 1970s,
               African Americans were consistently among the most liberal groups
               in the United States and were much further to the left than White
               Americans on most issues. Starting in the 1980s, Black public
               opinion began to move to the center, and this trend has deepened
               since. Why is this the case? Katherine Tate contends that Black
               political incorporation and increased affluence since the civil
               rights movement have made Black politics and public opinion more
               moderate over time. Black leaders now have greater opportunity to
               participate in mainstream politics, and Blacks look to elected
               officials rather than activists for political leadership. Black
               socioeconomic concerns have moved to the center as poverty has
               declined and their economic opportunities have improved. Based on
               solid analysis of public opinion data from the 1970s to the
               present, Tate examines how Black opinions on welfare, affirmative
               action, crime control, school vouchers, civil rights for other
               minorities, immigration, the environment, and U.S. foreign policy

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTThis contribution highlights the need and benefits of a
               mixed methodological approach in intersectional studies of
               symbolic representation. Existing research concerning symbolic
               representation among traditionally marginalized groups such as
               women, racial and ethnic minorities focuses on the role either
               gender or race/ethnic identity plays in shaping symbolic forms of
               representation such as communication or presentation of self.
               However, extant literature tells us very little about the
               experiences of elected officials who are both women and racial
               and/or ethnic minorities, which are substantively different from
               those of either Anglo women or minority men. We will first argue
               for the benefits of an intersectional approach to studying
               symbolic representation in the U.S. that uses both quantitative
               and qualitative methods. Through the use of quantitative and
               qualitative content analysis in our own work, we were able to
               offer a more nuanced picture of how identity informs symbolic
               representation. As scholars with very different methodological
               training and different identities, we will detail the ways in
               which the practice of working together expanded our own
               understanding of how to identify and measure symbolic
               representation among diverse members of Congress.",

               political activism and for women to be seen as strong political

               African American women—who live in a double bind of racial and
               gender discrimination. In this chapter, Nadia E. Brown, Guillermo
               Caballero, Fernando Tormos, Allison Wong, and Sharonda Woodford
               argue that despite criticism of Second-Wave feminists for
               ignoring the intersection of race and genderintersectionality,
               the movement, when viewed in conjunction with the African
               American Civil Rights Movement proved influential for Black women
               who came of age during this period, launching a generation of
               female, African American state political leaders. Specifically,
               Brown and colleagues examine differences in class and
               generational cohorts among African American female state
               legislators from 1990 to 2014. They focus primarily on African
               American female state legislators in the South since that is
               where most African Americans live and where female African
               Americans have had the most electoral success. In order to
               explicate the ways in which race and gender function in tandem,
               Brown et al. profile two African American female state
               legislators from Maryland. From this in-depth case study, the
               authors are able to provide a more nuanced description of how
               these two legislators championed policies designed to help the
               most marginalized people in their community—an approach that

               through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Yet, the
               physical isolation of MTurk participants, and perceived lack of
               experimental control have led to persistent concerns about the
               quality of the data that can be obtained from MTurk samples. In
               this paper we focus on two of the most salient concerns—that
               MTurk participants may not buy into interactive experiments and
               that they may produce unreliable or invalid data. We review
               existing research on these topics and present new data to address
               these concerns. We find that insufficient attention is no more a
               problem among MTurk samples than among other commonly used
               convenience or high-quality commercial samples, and that MTurk
               participants buy into interactive experiments and trust
               researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies.
               Furthermore, we find that employing rigorous exclusion methods
               consistently boosts statistical power without introducing
               problematic side effects (e.g., substantially biasing the
               post-exclusion sample), and can thus provide a general solution
               for dealing with problematic respondents across samples. We

               (advertising, political rhetoric, etc.), self-persuasion is
               indirect and entails placing people in situations where they are
               motivated to persuade themselves to change their own attitudes or
               behavior. We find that where important attitudes, behavior, or
               lifestyle changes are concerned, self-persuasion strategies
               produce more powerful and more long-lasting effects than do
               direct techniques of persuasion. This is primarily due to the
               fact that in direct persuasion, members of an audience are
               constantly aware of the fact that someone is trying (or has
               tried) to influence them. In a self-persuasion situation, people
               are convinced that the motivation for change comes from within.

               across a wide range of political behaviors. These biases are then
               demonstrated through a diverse and cross-disciplinary set of
               analyses, for instance: in citizens' ratings of presidents and
               prime ministers; in aggregate-level reactions to economic news,

               quality of the data that can be obtained from MTurk samples. In
               this paper we focus on two of the most salient concerns—that

               that they may produce unreliable or invalid data. We review

               participants buy into interactive experiments and trust
               researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies.

               Political Advocacy}",
  author    = "Karpf, David",
  publisher = "Oxford University Press",
  abstract  = "The Internet is facilitating a generational transition within
               America's advocacy group system. New ``netroots'' political
               associations have arisen in the past decade and play an
               increasingly prominent role in citizen political mobilization. At
               the same time, the organizations that mediate citizen political
               engagement and sustained collective action are changing. They
               rely upon modified staff structures and work routines. They
               employ novel strategies and tactical repertoires. Rather than
               ``organizing without organizations,'' the new media environment
               has given rise to ``organizing through different organizations.''
               The MoveOn Effect provides a richly detailed analysis of this
               disruptive transformation. It highlights changes in membership
               and fundraising regimes - established industrial patterns of
               supporter interaction and revenue streams - that were pioneered
               by MoveOn.org and have spread broadly within the advocacy system.
               Through interviews, content analysis, and direct observation of
               the leading netroots organizations, the book offers fresh
               insights into 21st century political organizing. The book
               highlights important variations among the new organizations -
               including internet-mediated issue generalists like MoveOn,
               community blogs like DailyKos.com, and neo-federated groups like
               DemocracyforAmerica.com. It also explores a wider set of netroots
               infrastructure organizations that provide supporting services to
               membership-based advocacy associations. The rise of the political
               netroots has had a distinctly partisan character: conservatives
               have repeatedly tried and failed to build equivalents to the
               organizations and infrastructure of the progressive netroots. The
               MoveOn Effect investigates these efforts, as well as the
               late-forming Tea Party movement, and introduces the theory of
               Outparty Innovation Incentives as an explanation for the partisan
               adoption of political technology. Written by a political
               scientist who is also a longtime political organizer, The MoveOn
               Effect offers a widely-accessible account of the Internet's
               impact on American politics. Operating at the intersection of
               practitioner and academic knowledge-traditions, Karpf provides a
               reassessment of many longstanding claims about new media and
               citizen political engagement.",

               simplifying through heuristics like indicators and ideology while
               the latter incorporates policy analysis and expertise to a
               greater degree. By employing two large datasets of U.S.
               congressional hearings to analyze policymakers' behavior of
               sending political messages, which we call “grandstanding,” we
               offer two findings. First, consistent with our hypotheses,
               grandstanding is more prevalent when committees are focused on
               new and emerging problems than when committees examine proposed
               alternatives or the implementation of existing policies. Second,
               the cognitive dynamics of problem solving and the incentives to
               grandstand vary depending on policy issues considered in
               hearings. Our analysis helps put dissatisfaction with
               contemporary U.S. policymaking in context: a rise in “messaging
               politics” derives at least in part from an increased focus on

               aligning one's self with a party, individuals become more likely
               to react to their political environment with anger and enthusiasm
               rather than fear. Anger and enthusiasm are associated with
               approach and continuation of current behavior, while fear
               triggers behavior reconsideration. In short, party identification
               stimulates participation via anger and enthusiasm. On the other
               hand, fear produces thought but not much action. We find support
               for our model using data from the American National Election
               Studies (ANES) and an original laboratory experiment.",

               Although theorists have been highlighting the role of emotions in
               politics for thousands of years, modern political psychologists
               primarily employ Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen's (2000) affective
               intelligence theory to grapple with the consequences of emotions
               for political attitudes and behavior. We present results from a
               formal meta‐analytic assessment exploring the strength of the
               empirical evidence for the relationship between emotions and
               political information search and decision strategies. Overall, we
               find weak but statistically reliable evidence linking anger,
               anxiety, and enthusiasm to information search when search is
               self‐reported, but when information search is objectively
               measured, we find no link between it and anxiety or enthusiasm.
               Surprisingly, we also find little reliable evidence linking
               emotions to differential reliance on heuristics or more
               evidence‐based criteria in voter decision‐making.",

               by detailing the ways in which liberals and conservatives
               approach political and social issues. In their moral foundations
               theory, Haidt and Joseph contend the divisions between liberals
               and conservatives are rooted in different views of morality. They
               demonstrate that humans consistently rely on five moral
               foundations. Two of these foundations—harm and fairness—are often
               labeled the individualizing foundations, as they deal with the
               role of individuals within social groups; the remaining three
               foundations—authority, ingroup loyalty, and purity—are the
               binding foundations as they pertain to the formation and
               maintenance of group bonds. Graham, Haidt, and Nosek demonstrate
               that liberals tend to disproportionately value the
               individualizing foundations, whereas conservatives value all five
               foundations equally. We extend this line of inquiry by examining
               whether different types of liberals and conservatives value the
               moral foundations to varying degrees. Using survey data (n =
               745), we rely on a mixed-mode latent class analysis and identify
               six ideological classes that favor unique social and fiscal
               policy positions. While most of the respondents belonging to
               these classes self-identify as conservative, they endorse the
               moral foundations in varying degrees. Since our findings
               demonstrate considerable heterogeneity with respect to ideology
               and moral preferences, we conclude by encouraging scholars to
               consider this heterogeneity in detailing the motivational and

               running variable and treatment begins at a particular threshold
               in time. In this guide for practitioners, we discuss several
               features of this regression discontinuity in time framework that
               differ from the more standard cross-sectional RD framework.
               First, many applications (particularly in environmental
               economics) lack cross-sectional variation and are estimated using
               observations far from the temporal threshold. This common
               empirical practice is hard to square with the assumptions of a
               cross-sectional RD, which is conceptualized for an estimation
               bandwidth shrinking even as the sample size increases. Second,
               estimates may be biased if the time-series properties of the data
               are ignored (for instance, in the presence of an autoregressive
               process), or more generally if short-run and long-run effects
               differ. Finally, tests for sorting or bunching near the threshold
               are often irrelevant, making the framework closer to an event
               study than a regression discontinuity design. Based on these
               features and motivated by hypothetical examples using air quality
               data, we offer suggestions for the empirical researcher wishing
               to use the RD in time framework.",

               conservative reactions to progressive (or liberal) social or
               political change (Faludi 1991 is a classic in this vein). Here,

               power, preferences, and interests. We focus mostly on examples

               propose using an estimand that is new for this context—the causal
               risk ratio, which has more transparent interpretation and
               requires weaker identification assumptions. We demonstrate this
               through a reanalysis of the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk dataset. Our

              causal effect of lower-level police contact on voter turnout. To
              do so, we leverage individual-level administrative ticketing data
              from Hillsborough County, Florida. We show that traffic stops
              materially decrease participation for Black and non-Black
              residents alike, and we also find temporal variation in the effect
              for Black voters. Although stops reduce turnout more for Black
              voters in the short term, they are less demobilizing over a longer
              time horizon. Although even low-level contacts with the police can
              reduce political participation across the board, our results point
              to a unique process of political socialization vis-à-vis the
              carceral state for Black Americans.",

               (2017). In particular, we revisit our claim that consensus within

               This “conflictual consensus” limits radical transformations of

               analyze how marginal positions and actors become part of the

               reshape its boundaries. We conclude by sketching out how scholars

  abstract  = "The history of criminal justice in the U.S. is often described as
               a pendulum, swinging back and forth between strict punishment and
               lenient rehabilitation. While this view is common wisdom, it is
               wrong. In Breaking the Pendulum, Philip Goodman, Joshua Page, and
               Michelle Phelps systematically debunk the pendulum perspective,
               showing that it distorts how and why criminal justice changes.
               The pendulum model blinds us to the blending of penal
               orientations, policies, and practices, as well as the struggle
               between actors that shapes laws, institutions, and how we think
               about crime, punishment, and related issues. Through a
               re-analysis of more than two hundred years of penal history,
               starting with the rise of penitentiaries in the 19th Century and
               ending with ongoing efforts to roll back mass incarceration, the
               authors offer an alternative approach to conceptualizing penal
               development. Their agonistic perspective posits that struggle is
               the motor force of criminal justice history. Punishment expands,
               contracts, and morphs because of contestation between real people
               in real contexts, not a mechanical ``swing'' of the pendulum.
               This alternative framework is far more accurate and empowering
               than metaphors that ignore or downplay the importance of struggle
               in shaping criminal justice. This clearly written, engaging book
               is an invaluable resource for teachers, students, and scholars
               seeking to understand the past, present, and future of American
               criminal justice. By demonstrating the central role of struggle
               in generating major transformations, Breaking the Pendulum
               encourages combatants to keep fighting to change the system.",

               Civilian protection is a primary purpose of UN peacekeeping, yet
               there is little systematic evidence for whether peacekeeping
               prevents civilian deaths. We propose that UN peacekeeping can
               protect civilians if missions are adequately composed of military
               troops and police in large numbers. Using unique monthly data on
               the number and type of UN personnel contributed to peacekeeping
               operations, along with monthly data on civilian deaths from 1991
               to 2008 in armed conflicts in Africa, we find that as the UN
               commits more military and police forces to a peacekeeping
               mission, fewer civilians are targeted with violence. The effect
               is substantial—the analyses show that, on average, deploying
               several thousand troops and several hundred police dramatically

               incentives to manipulate the economy for political gains. Unable
               to use monetary policy, and often limited in their ability to use
               fiscal spending, governments can resort to financial deregulation
               to generate short‐term political benefits. We show qualitatively
               and quantitatively that governments systematically weaken
               financial regulations in the aftermath of CBI, and that the
               effect of CBI is separate from an ideological shift toward
               liberalization. Our findings suggest that the growing
               financialization of the economy experienced by many countries

               when applied to close elections. Although many researchers invoke

               how sorting invalidates the design. When multiple-testing

                   covariates and/or time-invariant covariates. Our first main

                   commonly used two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regressions in
                   this context. In addition to issues related to multiple
                   periods and variation in treatment timing that have been
                   emphasized in the literature, we show that, even in the case
                   with only two time periods, TWFE regressions are not
                   generally robust to (i) paths of untreated potential outcomes
                   depending on the level of time-varying covariates (as opposed
                   to only the change in the covariates over time), (ii) paths
                   of untreated potential outcomes depending on time-invariant
                   covariates, and (iii) violations of linearity conditions for
                   outcomes over time and/or the propensity score. Even in cases
                   where none of the previous three issues hold, we show that
                   TWFE regressions can suffer from negative weighting and
                   weight-reversal issues. Thus, TWFE regressions can deliver
                   misleading estimates of causal effect parameters in a number

                   assessing the extent of misspecification bias arising due to
                   TWFE regressions. Finally, we propose alternative (and
                   simple) estimation strategies that can circumvent these

               across the 50 states. The COVI measures the time and effort
               required to vote, encompassing criteria such as registration
               requirements, voter identification laws, early voting
               availability, and absentee voting procedures. To keep pace with
               the changing nature of election laws, I include one new voting
               law to construct this year’s index: a requirement for multiple
               signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. In the 2024 rankings,
               Oregon remains the most accessible state for voters, while
               Mississippi is now the most restrictive. Furthermore, the
               research uncovers a trend of increasing polarization in voting
               accessibility, with Republican-controlled states generally
               enacting more stringent voting laws and Democratic-controlled
               states adopting more voter-friendly measures.",

               Nixon radio victory emerged in only a single poll conducted by
               Sindlinger and Company. Considering other polling data reveals
               Sindlinger’s finding is likely the result of a Republican bias in

               2-million vote swing for Kennedy; we find it implausible that the
               first debate can be linked in any meaningful way to the outcome
               of the election. We find it more meaningful that Nixon turned a

               he largely did so using television during the final two weeks of

               (RCTs) involving patients with arthritis and non-rheumatic

               studies (4657 patients, 45,862 controls) showed a non-significant
               association between NSAIDs and cardiac failure in a random effect

              level, community levels, and the intersection of individuals
              nested in communities. With a unique dataset that matches voter
              file data to a database on individual foreclosures, we show that

              turnout, both individually and for those in neighborhoods hit
              harder by the foreclosure crisis. We find that homeowners facing
              the loss of their homes were less likely to go to the polls.
              Consistent with previous research, we also show that turnout was
              suppressed in neighborhoods with higher rates of foreclosure.
              Taken together, our results suggest that political elites were
              less likely to hear from constituents most directly impacted by

               November 2018 and March 2019, we recruited participants and
               analyzed data from a nationally representative, probability-based
               online panel of U.S. adults, randomized to watch three
               first-person abortion video stories (intervention, n = 460) or
               three nature videos (control, n = 426). We measured
               community-level abortion stigma using the Community Abortion
               Attitudes Scale, Reproductive Experiences and Events Scale, and
               Community Level Abortion Stigma Scale at baseline, immediately
               after video exposure, and 3 months later. We dichotomized stigma
               change scores as decreased stigma compared with no change or
               increased stigma. Bivariate and logistic regression analysis
               accounted for complex survey methodology and sample weighting.
               RESULTS: Sample demographics reflected U.S. Census benchmarks
               (51\% female, 68\% White, 47\% aged 18-44 years). Most
               participants (83.1\%) completed the 3-month follow-up. Viewing
               the intervention videos was not associated with decreased stigma
               measured by Community Abortion Attitudes Scale or Community Level
               Abortion Stigma Scale immediately (odds ratio [OR], 0.80; 95\%
               confidence interval [CI], 0.59-1.09; OR, 1.28; 95\% CI,
               0.93-1.75) or at the 3-month follow-up (OR, 0.86; 95\% CI,
               0.62-1.19; OR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.70-1.37). Intervention exposure
               was associated with decreased stigma as measured by Reproductive
               Experiences and Events Scale immediately (OR, 1.74; 95\% CI,
               1.23-2.46); however, this association was not observed at the
               3-month follow-up (OR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.70-1.37). CONCLUSIONS:
               Exposure to first-person video stories may not decrease
               community-level abortion stigma among U.S. adults.",

               designs leveraging close elections are widely used to isolate
               effects of an elected politician characteristic on downstream
               outcomes. Unlike standard regression discontinuity designs,
               treatment is defined by a predetermined characteristic that could
               affect a politician's victory margin. I prove that, by
               conditioning on politicians who win close elections, PCRD
               estimators identify the effect of the specific characteristic of
               interest and all compensating differentials—candidate‐level
               characteristics that ensure elections remain close between
               candidates who differ in the characteristic of interest. Avoiding
               this asymptotic bias generally requires assuming either that the
               characteristic of interest does not affect candidate vote shares
               or that no compensating differential affects the outcome. Because
               theories of voting behavior suggest that neither strong
               assumption usually holds, I further analyze the implications for
               interpreting continuity tests and consider if and how covariate
               adjustment, bounding, and recharacterizing treatment can mitigate
               the posttreatment bias afflicting PCRD designs.",

               scholarship, activism, policy and broader discourse. The concept
               of abortion stigma is, however, poorly defined and scholarship
               tends to use the concept in ways that reaffirm the individual as
               its source and location. The majority of research frames abortion
               stigma as a set of values, beliefs and judgements that flow from

               stigma scholarship away from Goffman to Foucault, arguing that
               abortion stigma should be reframed as a classificatory form of
               power that works through designating relations of difference.
               Stigma is one of many processes through which abortion is made
               intelligible and is contingent and contested. This reframing has

               The systematic review was preregistered with PROSPERO
               (ID\#127339) and adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for
               Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Eight databases
               were screened for articles measuring abortion stigma. Data were
               extracted by four researchers and checked for accuracy by two
               reviewers. Psychometric properties were assessed with COSMIN
               guidelines. RESULTS: Of 102 articles reviewed, 21 reported
               original measures of abortion stigma. Instruments assessed
               individual and community level stigma for people who have had an
               abortion (n = 8), healthcare professionals (n = 4), and the
               public (n = 9), and predominantly originated from the United
               States (U.S.). Measures varied in structure, use, and
               comprehensiveness of psychometric properties. On psychometric
               properties, the Individual Level Abortion Stigma scale and
               Abortion Provider Stigma Scale - Revised performed best for
               individual-level stigma and the Stigmatising Attitudes, Beliefs

               abortion stigma measurement include geography, conceptualisation,
               and structural-level stigma. Continued development and testing of
               tools and methods for measuring abortion stigma is needed.",

               factor for the well-being of women who have had abortions, little

               METHODS: A systematic search of the databases Medline,
               PsycArticles, PsycInfo, PubMed and Web of Science was conducted;
               the search terms were ``(abortion OR pregnancy termination) AND
               stigma* .'' Articles were eligible for inclusion if the main
               research question addressed experiences of individuals subjected
               to abortion stigma, public attitudes that stigmatize women who
               have had abortions or interventions aimed at managing abortion
               stigma. To provide a comprehensive overview of this issue, any
               study published by February 2015 was considered. The search was
               restricted to English- and German-language studies. RESULTS:
               Seven quantitative and seven qualitative studies were eligible
               for inclusion. All but two dated from 2009 or later; the earliest
               was from 1984. Studies were based mainly on U.S. samples; some
               included participants from Ghana, Great Britain, Mexico, Nigeria,
               Pakistan, Peru and Zambia. The majority of studies showed that
               women who have had abortions experience fear of social judgment,
               self-judgment and a need for secrecy. Secrecy was associated with
               increased psychological distress and social isolation. Some
               studies found stigmatizing attitudes in the public. Stigma
               appeared to be salient in abortion providers' lives. Evidence of
               interventions to reduce abortion stigma was scarce. Most studies
               had limitations regarding generalizability and validity.
               CONCLUSION: More research, using validated measures, is needed to
               enhance understanding of abortion stigma and thereby reduce its

               polarization among the mass public, focusing on the classic
               typology of ?easy? and ?hard? issues (Carmines and Stimson, 1980)
               and the influence of the individual-level motivational variable,
               which is the need to evaluate. Objective Carmines and Stimson
               (1980) suggest that issues are characterized by their ?hardness,?
               the degree of how much issues are easy to understand and make
               political evaluations. This article contends that the NTE would
               positively relate to attitude extremity of ?hard? issues, which
               require extensive motivations for political judgment but would
               not necessarily be associated with attitude extremity of ?easy?
               issues, which do not require such motivations. Methods In the
               analyses, four ?easy? issues (abortion, same-sex marriage,
               affirmative action, and gun control) and four ?hard? issues
               (immigration, tax, health care, and climate change) were selected
               to compare the effects of the NTE on attitude extremity, based on
               previous literature. The data of 2016 American National Election
               Survey was used to test the hypotheses. Results The analyses
               using the data of the 2016 American National Election Survey
               supported the hypotheses by showing that the need to evaluate was
               related to increased attitude extremity on all ?hard? issues,
               whereas need to evaluate was not associated with extremity on
               ?easy? issues except the issue of affirmative action. Conclusion
               Need to evaluate is related to attitude extremity on ?easy? and
               ?hard? issues.",

               address this oversight by reviewing existing literature and
               integrating new analyses of several large-scale, cross-sectional,
               and longitudinal datasets to identify the demographic and
               ideological correlates of abortion attitudes. Our review and new
               analyses indicate that abortion support is increasing modestly
               over time in both the United States and New Zealand. We also find
               that a plurality of respondents (43.8\%) in the United States are
               consistently ?pro-choice,? whereas 14.8\% are consistently
               ?pro-life,? across various elective and traumatic abortion
               scenarios. We then show that age, religiosity, and conservatism
               correlate negatively, whereas Openness to Experience correlates
               positively, with abortion support. New analyses of heterosexual
               couples further reveal that women's and men's religiosity
               decrease their romantic partner's abortion support. Noting
               inconsistent gender differences in attitudes toward abortion, we
               then discuss the impact of traditional gender-role attitudes and
               sexism on abortion attitudes and conclude that, rather than
               misogyny, benevolent sexism?the belief that women should be
               cherished and protected?best explains opposition to abortion. Our
               review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the demographic
               and ideological variables that underly abortion attitudes and,
               hence, the broader culture war.",

               our understanding of the contemporary practice of feminism?
               Questioning the importance of this claim now invites us to
               critically reflect upon the trajectory Western feminism has
               followed in light of the efforts made by the Women’s Liberation
               movement to politicise formerly unquestioned aspects of social
               relations. In this paper, the significance of this feminist
               slogan will be assessed by locating it within two broadly defined
               historical periods. Firstly we identify the critical work
               performed by the ideas expressed in the slogan in the early years
               of the 1970s and then assess their continued relevance within the
               context of the early 21st century. Drawing upon the empirical
               analysis of young women’s experience of and relationship to
               feminism via their engagement with social media in Britain, this

               women explore their personal experiences. We aim to understand

               Political Action Committees (PACs) from 12,737 U.S. public
               companies between 2003 and 2018 to show that 16.7\% of employee

               educational governance and have become an increasingly common
               response to low performance. However, limited research explores
               whether this effectively improves student outcomes. We track all
               takeovers nationwide from the late 1980s, when the first
               takeovers occurred, through 2016 and describe takeover districts.
               While these districts are low performing, we find academic
               performance plays less of a role in predicting takeover for
               districts serving larger concentrations of African American
               students. We then use a new data source allowing for cross-state
               comparisons of student outcomes to estimate the effect of
               takeovers that occurred between 2011 and 2016. On average, we
               find no evidence that takeover generates academic benefits.
               Takeover appears to be disruptive in the early years of takeover,
               particularly to English Language Arts achievement, although the
               longer-term effects are less clear. We also observe considerable

              surveys and a matching technique, showing that union members,
              particularly those with less formal education, who face higher
              costs in seeking out political information, are significantly more
              politically knowledgeable than their non-union counterparts and
              better informed about where political parties and candidates stand
              on the issues. I conclude by discussing unions’ capacity to reduce
              knowledge gaps and foster a more politically informed electorate.",

               in 1992-93 and heroin throughout the three eras to distinguish
               between narratives used to describe the crack cocaine and opioid
               epidemics. FINDINGS: We find support for critics' hypotheses
               about the differential framing of the two epidemics: articles on
               the opioid epidemic are likelier to use medical terminology than
               criminal justice terminology while the reverse is true for crack
               cocaine articles. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that race
               and legality may influence policy responses to substance-use
               epidemics. Comparisons also suggest that the evolution of the
               media narrative on substance use cannot alone account for the
               divergence in framing between the two epidemics.",

               exemplar of unequal policing. Divisions by party and divisions by
               race interact to produce serious problems of representation on
               issues related to crime, policing, and violence. Black and white
               Democrats do not hold similar views; for both historical and
               electoral reasons, white Democrats have typically determined the

                   whether arrested individuals would have been subsequently
                   charged or convicted had they been a different race. It has
                   long been known that such counterfactual questions face
                   measurement challenges related to omitted-variable bias, and
                   conceptual challenges related to the definition of causal
                   estimands for largely immutable characteristics. Another
                   concern, which has been the subject of recent debates, is
                   post-treatment bias: many studies of discrimination condition

               Extant research suggests that these attitudes are intensely held,
               likely to evoke strong emotional responses, more stable and less
               amenable to compromise, and perceived to be universally true.
               Despite a large body of research on how morally convicted
               attitudes affect behavior and choice, several open questions
               remain about their antecedents. There are two questions central
               to this article: First, can the news media effectively
               communicate a sense of moral conviction to the mass public?
               Second, if so, what are the factors that cause these attitudes to
               become morally convicted? Drawing on framing theory, appraisal
               theory, and research in political communication, we hypothesize
               that moral conviction can be effectively communicated using
               episodic (as opposed to thematic) frames, and also, that
               emotional reactions to such frames contribute to the development
               of moral conviction. Using four survey experiments and two
               replications, we find some support for our hypotheses, but we
               also find that treatment effects are likely context dependent. We

                   introduced in Cattaneo, Idrobo and Titiunik (2020). Our first
                   goal is to present an alternative RD conceptual framework

                   approach can be useful in RD designs with discretely-valued

                   the continuity-based approach in other settings. Then,
                   employing both continuity-based and local randomization

               component effect (AMCE), which represents the causal effect of a
               single profile attribute while averaging over the remaining
               attributes. What has been overlooked, however, is the fact that
               the AMCE critically relies upon the distribution of the other
               attributes used for the averaging. Although most experiments
               employ the uniform distribution, which equally weights each

               interaction effect, called the average marginal interaction
               effect (AMIE). Unlike the conventional interaction effect, the
               relative magnitude of the AMIE does not depend on the choice of
               baseline conditions, making its interpretation intuitive even for
               higher-order interactions. We show that the AMIE can be
               nonparametrically estimated using ANOVA regression with weighted
               zero-sum constraints. Because the AMIEs are invariant to the

                   treatment effects of a single, binary treatment given a set

                   method to estimate the heterogeneous causal effects of
                   high-dimensional treatments, which poses unique challenges in
                   terms of estimation and interpretation. The proposed approach
                   is based on a Bayesian mixture of regularized logistic
                   regressions to identify groups of units who exhibit similar
                   patterns of treatment effects. By directly modeling cluster
                   membership with covariates, the proposed methodology allows
                   one to explore the unit characteristics that are associated

                   application is conjoint analysis, which is a popular survey

              arrivals, while similar islands slightly farther away did not.
              Leveraging a targeted survey of 2,070 island residents and
              distance to Turkey as an instrument, we find that direct exposure
              to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in
              natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim
              minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration
              policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary

               This article uses a doubly randomized survey experiment conducted
               on a nationally representative sample, where some subjects are
               randomly assigned to an informational treatment about opioids

              increasing hosts' resentment toward refugees. In contrast,

              transfers to Syrian refugees in Lebanon did not increase

              Exploring why aid does not increase hostility, we find evidence

              higher demand for local goods and services, directly benefit

               December 2020 across 109 states in Brazil, Mexico, and the United

               determining state-level policy stringency. In the United States

              experiment with subjects voting in hypothetical congressional
              primary elections, we find that respondents from both parties are

              Low-trust Democrats are particularly resistant to candidates

               open or tacit endorsement to widespread condemnation. I argue
               this occurred because of increasing publicity for lynchings.
               While locals justified nearby lynchings, publicity exposed
               lynching to distant, un-supportive audiences and allowed African
               Americans to safely articulate counternarratives and
               condemnations. I test this argument using data on lynchings, rail
               networks, and newspaper coverage of lynchings in millions of
               issues across thousands of newspapers. I find that lynchings in
               counties with greater access to publicity (via rail networks) saw
               more and geographically dispersed coverage, that distant coverage
               was more critical, and that increased risk of media exposure may

               so too have concerns about the use of convenience samples in

               distinguish between “external validity” and theoretical
               relevance, with the latter being the more important justification
               for any data collection strategy. We explore an alternative
               source of online convenience samples, the Lucid Fulcrum Exchange,
               and assess its suitability for online survey experimental
               research. Our point of departure is the 2012 study by Berinsky,
               Huber, and Lenz that compares Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to US
               national probability samples in terms of respondent
               characteristics and treatment effect estimates. We replicate
               these same analyses using a large sample of survey responses on

              interest advocacy for nearly a century, as marginalized
              communities air their grievances in search for substantive policy
              change. While groups organize and demonstrate in a peaceful
              manner, there is no guarantee that onlookers will perceive them as
              such. We find it necessary to explore what factors shape
              perceptions of social movement protests and how the racial
              composition of a demonstration can elicit dramatically different
              responses from onlookers. Methods: To examine the impact of racial
              identity on protest evaluations, we conduct a survey experiment on
              a total of 921 respondents. We simulate a media report concerning
              a Black Lives Matter protest to determine how subtle changes in
              the racial composition of the demonstration elicit varying
              perceptions of a potential for violence. Results: We find that
              protests that comprise all-Black participants are perceived to
              have a higher probability to end in violence than more diverse
              demonstrations. These findings come despite an assurance that the
              protest in question was peaceful. Consistent with minority threat
              theory, these perceptions are largely driven by the sentiments of
              white respondents. Conclusion: We argue that ill-conceived threat
              perceptions, rooted in the racial composition of Black Lives
              Matter protests, complicate the mission of those charged with
              making visible the plight of Black Americans. Even when Black
              protesters adhere to the “rules” of non-violent protest, there is
              no guarantee that the biases of onlookers will not drown out their
              efforts. These findings have wide reaching implications on the
              exercise of First Amendment right to protest, the role of the

              sparked by lethal confrontations between police officers and

              unwavering support for the police, while Hillary Clinton and

              called for criminal justice reform. Method: We conducted a framing
              experiment to test whether exposure to images designed to evoke a
              range of hostile to benign police–civilian interactions affected
              respondents’ vote preference in the lead-up to the presidential
              election. Results: We found that exposure to an image of
              police–civilian interactions decreased the likelihood that a
              respondent would choose not to express a vote preference. This
              effect was most pronounced among political independents and

              choice, and this effect varied across political partisanship.

              21st-century American politics. We also find some evidence

              variables (M) that constitute possible pathways for the treatment
              effect. There is no consensus on whether surveys should measure
              potentially mediating variables before or after the outcome
              variables-MO or OM. We use a replication exercise to demonstrate
              how the order of mediator and outcome items can be consequential
              for the results from causal mediation analysis. Order can affect
              mediation conclusions, even if the treatment effect is similar
              across designs. As such, randomizing order is usually prudent,
              although best practice depends on the researcher's contextual
              knowledge about her particular application. C ausal mediation
              analysis (CMA) aims to decompose treatment effects by mediating
              channel. It is rapidly growing in popularity, especially in
              survey-experimental work. When designing an instrument, an
              important choice arises: whether to measure outcomes then
              mediators (an OM design) or mediators then outcomes (MO). It is
              unclear which to prefer, and there is no consensus in the existing
              literature. MO resembles the posited causal sequence, but
              researchers often measure the outcome directly after treatment ,
              to prevent intervening questions from moderating treatment
              effects. In this short article, we argue that the OM/MO choice can
              affect (1) the distribution of outcome variables or mediators, (2)
              the effect of treatment on either, and (3) mediation results ,
              even when it does not moderate the overall treatment effect. The
              first two occur because ordering can alter how respondents
              understand later questions, by priming latent thoughts or framing
              issues, or because survey fatigue induces satisficing or anchoring
              in later questions. The third effect is more subtle: even if the
              treatment effect is similar under both designs, the proportions of
              the effect attributed to a particular mediator can still change.
              Importantly, this effect can occur even when the first two do not.
              After describing these three effects theoretically, we demonstrate

               counties in terms of their homogeneous , heterogeneous, or
               bifurcated racial/ethnic composition. We argue racial/ethnic
               context is critical beyond individual-level factors; this context
               is central in explaining public policy, especially policies that
               affect minority groups. The vote for Proposition 187 is expected
               to be the highest in ``bifur-cated'' counties with large Latino
               populations. Regression analysis is used to statistically model
               the county-level vote for the initiative relative to the size of
               racial/ethnic populations, economic conditions , and party.
               Bifurcated counties with large Latino populations strongly
               supported Proposition 187, as well as homogeneous counties with
               predominately white and very small minority populations.
               California's white/Latino bifurcated racial/ethnic composition
               may parallel the white/black bifurca-tion of the deep South in an
               earlier era. The importance of the theory and empirical findings
               presented extend beyond California to national and subnational
               politics. WXThile ethnicity/race is often seen as important in
               U.S. politics, it has not always been systematically incorporated
               into political science research (Hero and Tolbert 1996; Radcliff
               and Saiz 1994). This study examines voting patterns on
               California's 1994 ``illegal immigration'' initiative, Proposition
               187. Consistent with a ``racial/ ethnic diversity''
               interpretation of politics and policy in the states, it finds
               that racial/ethnic diversity plays an important role in
               explaining county-level support for Proposition 187 (Hero and
               Tolbert 1996; cf. Wolfinger and Greenstein 1968). California
               voters supported Proposition 187 by a 59\%-41\% overall margin.
               The ballot initiative denies social services, nonemergency health
               care, and education to illegal immigrants and requires public
               agencies to report suspected illegal immigrants to state and
               federal authorities. Although federal courts placed an injunction
               on implementation of parts of the measure days after the
               election, this policy has important implications for both

               political conformity. Whose norms are people likely to follow,
               and why? This article discusses two phenomena—social identity and
               “self-conscious” emotions—that are key to understanding when and
               why people follow the crowd. It argues that adherence to in-group
               norms is a critical basis of status among in-group peers.
               Conformity generates peer approval and leads to personal pride.
               Deviance generates disapproval and causes embarrassment or shame.
               These emotional reactions color an individual’s political
               perspectives, typically generating conformity. These same
               mechanisms can spur between-group polarization. In this case,
               differentiation from the norms of disliked out-groups results in
               peer approval and pride, and conformity to out-group norms
               disapproval and embarrassment or shame. This framework is

              affect current treatment. Furthermore, we introduce a new

              political economy, which frequently uses TSCS data. We begin with
              a discussion of specification and lay out the theoretical
              differences implied by the various types of dynamic models that
              can be estimated. It is shown that there is nothing pernicious in
              using a lagged dependent variable and that all dynamic models
              either implicitly or explicitly have such a variable; the
              differences between the models relate to assumptions about the
              speeds of adjustment of measured and unmeasured variables. When
              adjustment is quick, it is hard to differentiate between the
              various models; with slower speeds of adjustment, the various
              models make sufficiently different predictions that they can be
              tested against each other. As the speed of adjustment gets slower
              and slower, specification (and estimation) gets more and more

              correlated errors can easily be estimated; it is only ordinary
              least squares that is inconsistent in this situation. There is a

              confusion arose in part because data constraints have prompted

              The result is a conflicting and at times misleading body of
              evidence. To move toward a scientific consensus, scholars should

               Massachusetts Gubernatorial election, Black candidates for the US
               House, and Black candidates for the US Senate. The other two are
               tests of the notion that White racial identity reduced President
               Obama’s approval, thus reducing support for all Democratic
               Congressional candidates in the 2010 Midterm and 2012
               Congressional elections. We find support for these notions in all
               seven cases, across these seven elections, using four different
               survey research datasets, and four different measures of White
               identity. Comparisons with other presidential elections show that
               White identity did not significantly affect mono-racial
               elections. Furthermore, we find the White identity and racial
               resentment results to be very similar in terms of their
               robustness and apparent effect sizes. This indicates in-group
               evaluations, and those that focus on out-groups, operate
               independently of one another.",

              Considered second are vignette interpretations and responses, in
              particular open and closed questioning; vignette perspectives; and
              diffi culties with interpreting and responding to vignettes.
              Together these explorations contribute to the wider appreciation

              social research is concerned with the study of beliefs, attitudes,
              values and perceptions. These topics raise many challenges for the
              application of social research methodologies which aim to capture,
              as fully as possible, the reality of people's lives. Empirical
              research questions underpin the adoption of particular research
              methodologies. Answering these research questions is informed by
              the kinds of information required and how best this information
              can be obtained. Other factors also infl uence the research
              questions posed and the methodologies considered most appropriate
              to answering them. For example, the epistemological stance of
              researchers may determine the choice of particular research
              questions and subsequent research methodologies. There may be
              ethical issues arising from, for example, the study of certain

               in data collection. Vignette technique is a data collection tool,
               which has been used for over 50 years in different disciplines
               including health sciences. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of
               information regarding this method. With this background in mind,
               the present review aimed to provide thorough information about
               the vignette technique. Methods: This was a narrative review
               conducted through searching of databases of ISI Web of Science
               (65), PubMed (27), Scopus (24), CINAHL (110), ProQuest (23), ERIC
               (44) as well as Science Direct (123) using keywords including
               “vignette”, “qualitative research”, “quantitative research”, and
               ``research” from their inception to September, 2018 to assess
               those studies regarding different aspects of vignettes. Out of
               416 documents, a number of 105 books and articles were reviewed
               regarding the different aspects of the vignettes. No language
               restrictions were imposed. Results: Vignettes are used in
               different forms including text, illustrations, images, videotape
               and cartoons, computer-based data, and music as an elicitation
               tool to provide supplementary and complementary data during a
               research process. Using this technique, the researcher can
               collect some data which is not accessible through other sources.
               At the same time, the researchers should be cautious about its
               accurate design and validity to get more realistic data.
               Conclusion: Vignettes as an effective tool can be employed in
               both quantitative and qualitative research to collect more
               diverse and thorough data, particularly, in cross-cultural

              approaches to cybersecurity emphasize either international
              state-to-state logics (such as deter-rence theory) or the
              integrity of individual information systems. Neither provides a
              good understanding of new ``soft cyber'' attacks that involve the
              manipulation of expectations and common understand-ings. We argue
              that scaling up computer security arguments to the level of the
              state, so that the entire polity is treated as an information
              system with associated attack surfaces and threat models, provides
              the best immediate way to understand these attacks and how to
              mitigate them. We demonstrate systematic differences between how
              autocracies and democracies work as information systems, because
              they rely on different mixes of common and contested political
              knowledge. Stable autocracies will have common knowledge over who
              is in charge and their associated ideological or policy goals, but
              will generate contested knowledge over who the various political
              actors in society are, and how they might form coalitions and gain
              public support, so as to make it more difficult for coalitions to
              displace the regime. Stable democracies will have contested
              knowledge over who is in charge, but common knowledge over who the
              political actors are, and how they may form coalitions and gain
              public support. These differences are associated with notably
              different attack surfaces and threat models. Specifically,
              democracies are vulnerable to measures that ``flood'' public
              debate and disrupt shared decentralized understandings of actors
              and coalitions, in ways that autocracies are not.",

  abstract = "Abstract Causal mediation analysis is widely used across many
              disciplines to investigate possible causal mechanisms. Such an
              analysis allows researchers to explore various causal pathways,
              going beyond the estimation of simple causal effects. Recently,
              Imai et al. (2008) [3] and Imai et al. (2009) [2] devel- oped
              general algorithms to estimate causal mediation effects with the
              variety of data types that are often encountered in practice. The
              new algorithms can estimate causal mediation effects for linear
              and nonlinear relationships, with parametric and nonparametric
              models, with continuous and discrete medi- ators, and with various
              types of outcome variables. In this paper, we show how to
              implement these algorithms in the statistical computing language
              R. Our easy-to-use software, mediation, takes advantage of the
              object-oriented programming nature of the R language and allows
              researchers to estimate causal mediation effects in a
              straightforward manner. Finally, mediation also implements

               characteristics. In the 2016 Presidential contest, political

               demonstrated that a majority of white women voted for Donald

               intersectionality and system justification theory as frameworks

               Using data from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election

               analyze the data presented in the U.S. Police-Shooting Database
               (USPSD) in order to investigate the extent of racial bias in the
               shooting of American civilians by police officers in recent
               years. In contrast to previous work that relied on the FBI's
               Supplemental Homicide Reports that were constructed from
               self-reported cases of police-involved homicide, this data set is
               less likely to be biased by police reporting practices.
               County-specific relative risk outcomes of being shot by police
               are estimated as a function of the interaction of: 1) whether
               suspects/civilians were armed or unarmed, and 2) the
               race/ethnicity of the suspects/civilians. The results provide
               evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black
               Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the
               probability of being {black, unarmed, and shot by police} is
               about 3.49 times the probability of being {white, unarmed, and
               shot by police} on average. Furthermore, the results of
               multi-level modeling show that there exists significant
               heterogeneity across counties in the extent of racial bias in
               police shootings, with some counties showing relative risk ratios
               of 20 to 1 or more. Finally, analysis of police shooting data as
               a function of county-level predictors suggests that racial bias
               in police shootings is most likely to emerge in police
               departments in larger metropolitan counties with low median
               incomes and a sizable portion of black residents, especially when
               there is high financial inequality in that county. There is no

               and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that
               the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is
               not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.",

               gender are poorly measured in survey research. The principal
               problem is the conflation of gender with sex in survey research.
               Consequently, gender is typically treated as a dichotomy, with no

              central to government responsiveness and democratic policy making.
              While previous research on political behavior has explored the
              influence of collective economic conditions , self-interested
              explanations have heavily swayed work on policy preferences. We
              bridge these two previously distinct literatures to articulate a
              theory of public policy preferences that highlights when both
              common and pocketbook factors influence preferences for social
              insurance. Using a cross-national sample of developed democracies
              from 1996 and 2006, we conclude that when personal economic
              conditions are dire, the pull of self-interest trumps both
              collective and policy concerns. W hat affects individuals' policy
              preferences remains a key question that connects fundamental
              aspects of democratic governance: public opinion, government
              responsiveness, and policy making. An important theoretical aspect
              of this relationship between individuals and their government has
              been the connection between the public policies governments create
              and the public's attitudes toward those policies. Although
              scholars have debated how pocketbook (personal) and sociotropic
              (collective) interests can shape political opinion and behavior,
              we consider whether these interests shape individuals' policy
              preferences by defining the stakes they face within a policy
              environment. Explanations of individual political behavior and
              opinion point to the influences of both personal and collective
              interests. Although arguments of self-interest as a driving
              influence on behavior have shaped theories in social science, the
              empirical evidence has been less decisive (Lynch and Myrskyla
              2009; Sears and Funk 1990, 1991). In distinguishing between
              sources of economic concern, scholars have shown how common
              experiences can influence individual political attitudes and
              behavior more so than personal concerns (Duch and Stevenson 2008;
              Mutz 1998; Singer and Carlin 2013), highlighting the importance of
              collective circumstances. While theories of political behavior
              more broadly have come to recognize the importance of collective
              interests, research on public policy attitudes and preferences has
              maintained an emphasis on the role of self-interest and individual
              insecurity (Baslevent and Kirmanoglu 2011; Chong, Citrin, and
              Conley 2001; Mutz 1998). From a focus on the effect of income
              (Meltzer and Richard 1981), scholars have branched into theorizing
              about how the risk of unemployment shapes preferences for
              government assistance (Cusack, Iversen,"

               Despite decades of scholarship, researchers have failed to reach

               are unstable but disagree about whether that instability is real

               Converse called knowledge of “what goes with what.” Using surveys
               spanning decades in the United States and the United Kingdom, we
               find that individuals hold stable views primarily when they
               possess this knowledge and agree with their party. These results
               imply that observed opinion instability arises not primarily from
               measurement error but from instability in the opinions
               themselves. We find many US citizens lack knowledge of “what goes
               with what” and that only about 20\%–40\% hold stable views on

               more likely than individual economic considerations to animate
               political behavior, yet the former concerns are no less rational
               than the latter. Third, individuals vary in how strongly they
               identify with politically relevant groups, masking considerable
               variation in the degree to which group affiliations shape
               political behavior. Therefore, group identification is not a
               monolithic, irrational force that affects people regardless of

              We conducted an experiment to determine if more aggressive media
              fact-checking could correct the false belief that the Affordable
              Care Act would create ``death panels.'' Participants from an
              opt-in Internet panel were randomly assigned to either a control

              The correction reduced belief in death panels and strong
              opposition to the reform bill among those who view Palin
              unfavorably and those who view her favorably but have low

              theories of ideological sorting suggest gender gaps should exist
              primarily between political parties, gender socialization theories
              contend that critical differences lie at the intersection of

              women reporting significantly more moderate views than their male

              determine political attitudes, and thus may account substantially
              for the political cohesion of those who share the identity. This
              mechanism is illustrated with analyses of the causes and
              consequences of the acquisition of lesbian, gay or bisexual
              identity. Seldom shared by parents and offspring, gay identity
              provides a rare opportunity to cleanly identify the selection

               reference to the attribution theory to help explain why rape
               victims are sometimes seen as deserving of their misfortune.
               Findings indicate that men demonstrate higher rape myth
               acceptance than women and attribute higher levels of blame to
               victims than women; women who violate traditional gender roles
               are attributed more blame than those women who do not; and women
               who consume alcohol prior to their attack are attributed higher
               levels of blame than those who are not intoxicated. The findings
               are discussed with reference to the implications for the Criminal
               Justice System and future interventions for both victims and
               perpetrators of rape. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

               majority rule, the permanent exclusion of minorities is always a
               possibility. This raises a crucial question: what psychological
               mechanisms may allow members of a majority to identify with the
               political goals of a minority group? One possibility is that they
               are precisely the same mechanisms responsible for motivating
               minority members themselves to identify with the minority's
               political goals. According to the racial attitudes literature,
               African Americans are motivated by feelings of closeness toward
               Blacks to support pro-Black policies. This study investigates the
               possibility that feelings of closeness toward Blacks may also
               motivate White Americans to support pro-Black policies. To
               circumvent possible social desirability effects often associated
               with questions of race, feelings of closeness are measured both
               on the conscious (explicit) and nonconscious (implicit) levels.
               The implicit closeness measure is based on the idea of
               ``cognitive self-other overlap'' (Aron, Aron, Tudor, \& Nelson,
               1991) and has previously been used to measure nonconscious

               represents an application of this measure to the group level of
               racial intergroup relations. The study is based on a sample of
               555 college students of diverse racial backgrounds. Results of a
               Granger-causality test support the construct validity of the

               together with participants of other backgrounds. Political and

               Self-identification as conservative vs. liberal is regarded as a

               This research evaluates the thesis that conservative-liberal
               identity functions as a readiness to adopt beliefs and attitudes
               about newly politicized issues that one is told are consistent
               with the socially prescribed meaning of conservatism-liberalism.
               In Study 1, conservative-liberal identity, measured in 2000, had
               an independent prospective effect on support for invading Iraq in
               2002 and support for the Iraq war in 2004, controlling for
               substantive ideology, party identity, and demographics. In Study
               2, conservative- and liberal-identifiers adopted stances on farm

               Latino voters to 6\% and 3\%, respectively, while maintaining the
               true positive rate above 80\%. Moreover, we use our predictions

              support for the overall profile relative to a baseline, averaging
              across all respondents and other features. While the AMCE has a

  abstract = "Most measures of social conflict processes are derived from
              primary and secondary source reports. In many cases, reports are
              used to create event-level data sets by aggregating information
              from multiple, and often conflicting, reports to single event
              observations. We argue that this pre-aggregation is less innocuous
              than it seems, costing applied researchers opportunities for
              improved inference. First, researchers cannot evaluate the
              consequences of different methods of report aggregation. Second,
              aggregation discards report-level information (i.e., variation
              across reports) that is useful in addressing measurement error
              inherent in event data. Therefore, we advocate that data should be
              supplied and analyzed at the report level. We demonstrate the
              consequences of using aggregated event data as a predictor or
              outcome variable, and how analysis can be improved using
              report-level information directly. These gains are demonstrated
              with simulated-data experiments and in the analysis of real-world
              data, using the newly available Mass Mobilization in Autocracies

               Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater
               interaction between like-minded individuals, results in
               polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model of

               polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We
               generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known
               in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with
               mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals
               draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving
               at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of
               homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process
               results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased.
               In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is
               not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased
               assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing

               political participation has made it almost an article of faith
               that members of dominant groups (such as White people and
               individuals of higher socioeconomic status) vote at higher rates
               than their less privileged counterparts, recent work has
               suggested that there are circumstances under which members of
               marginalized groups might participate at higher rates. Some of
               this research suggests that political participation might also
               increase when groups perceive elections as particularly
               threatening. We argue that when such threats are faced by
               marginalized groups, the concern to protect hard-earned rights
               can activate a sense of what we call ``political
               hypervigilance,'' and that such effects may be particularly
               pronounced among members of intersectionally-marginalized groups
               such as LGBT African Americans. To test this theory, we use
               original data from the 2016 National Survey on HIV in the Black
               Community, a nationally-representative survey of Black Americans,
               to explore the relationship among same-sex sexual behavior,
               attitudes toward LGBT people, and respondent voting intentions in
               the 2016 presidential election. We find that respondents who
               reported having engaged in same-sex sexual behavior were strongly
               and significantly more likely to say they ``definitely will
               vote'' compared to respondents who reported no same-sex sexual
               behavior. More favorable views of LGBT individuals and issues
               (marriage equality) were also associated with greater intention
               to vote. We argue that these high rates provide preliminary
               evidence that political hypervigilance can, in fact, lead to
               increased political engagement among members of marginalized
               groups.",

  abstract = "Recent years have seen a rush towards evidence-based tools in
              criminal justice. As part of this movement, many jurisdictions
              have adopted actuarial risk assessment to supplement or replace
              the ad-hoc decisions of judges. Proponents of risk assessment
              tools claim that they can dramatically reduce incarceration
              without harming public safety. Critics claim that risk assessment
              will exacerbate racial disparities. Despite extensive and heated
              rhetoric, there is virtually no evidence on how use of this
              “evidence-based” tool affects key outcomes such as incarceration
              rates, crime, or racial disparities. The research discussing what
              “should” happen as a result of risk assessment is hypothetical and
              largely ignores the complexities of implementation. This Article
              is one of the first studies to document the impacts of risk
              assessment in practice. It evaluates pretrial risk assessment in
              Kentucky, a state that was an early adopter of risk assessment and
              is often cited as an example of best-practices in the pretrial
              area. Using rich data on more than one million criminal cases, the
              paper shows that a 2011 law making risk assessment a mandatory
              part of the bail decision led to a significant change in bail
              setting practice, but only a small increase in pretrial release.
              These changes eroded over time as judges returned to their
              previous habits. Furthermore, the increase in releases was not
              cost-free: failures-to-appear and pretrial crime increased as
              well. Risk assessment had no effect on racial disparities in
              pretrial detention once differing regional trends were accounted
              for. Kentucky’s experience does not mean we should abandon risk
              assessment, but it should temper the hyperbolic hopes (and fears)
              about its effects. Risk assessment in practice is different from
              risk assessment in the abstract, and its impacts depend on context
              and details of implementation. If indeed risk assessment is
              capable of producing large benefits, it will take research and
              experimentation to learn how to achieve them. Such a process would
              be evidence-based criminal justice at its best: not a flocking
              towards methods that bear the glossy veneer of science, but a
              careful and iterative evaluation of what works and what does not.",

              prediction by race and gender of one pretrial risk assessment, the
              Public Safety Assessment (PSA). The PSA was developed with support
              from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation (LJAF) to reduce the
              burden placed on vulnerable populations at the frontend of the
              criminal justice system. The growing and disparate use of
              incarceration is one of the most pressing social issues facing the
              U.S. Although it has received less attention, pretrial populations
              are a large and growing contributor of mass incarceration. The
              pretrial phase is often said to be the most consequential in the
              criminalizing process because it is related a higher likelihood of
              conviction, longer terms of incarceration, and has the potential
              to destabilize families. Recognizing the inherent challenges in
              pretrial release decisions, there has been increased development
              and use of pretrial risk assessments. Pretrial risk assessments
              are developed to identify the likelihood that defendants will
              remain crime free and that they will return to court. There have
              been several critiques of risk assessments, but none have assessed
              differential validity or prediction using pretrial outcomes. Using
              a statewide dataset from Kentucky (n = 164,597) we found the PSA
              to have predictive validity measures in line with what are
              generally accepted within the criminal justice field. We applied a
              regression modeling approach commonly used to assess bias in test
              instruments (e.g., cognitive and employment testing), and found
              some instances of differential prediction by race. These
              differences suggest that the PSA scores to predict failure to
              appear (FTA) are moderated by race, with no significant
              differences found for new crimes and new violent crimes between
              black and white defendants. The findings show differential
              prediction for new violent criminal arrests between male and
              female defendants, similar to what was found by Skeem et al.
              (2016). In the end, we point to data limitations that weaken
              external validity, point to areas for future research, and suggest
              that risk assessments are not silver bullets, but rather
              decision-making tools that require ongoing refinement.",

                 enforcement, a critical ingredient in public safety, 1 is
                 tenuous at best. 2 Residents of these high-crime, heavily
                 disadvantaged communities witness and experience intensive
                 police presence, high rates of incarceration and community
                 supervision, and concentrated violence and question the intent,
                 effectiveness, and equity of the criminal justice system. 3
                 Indeed, police may carry out aggressive strategies that target
                 quality-of-life infractions and drug-, gun-, and gang-related
                 violence in ways that undermine public confidence. 4 Perhaps
                 not surprisingly, areas with high levels of mistrust tend to be
                 those that are heavily policed, where police use tactics such
                 as pretextual stops i that damage their relationship with the
                 people they are charged to protect. 5 The results can be
                 far-reaching: a distrust of the criminal justice system, an
                 unwillingness to cooperate with the police, 6 and a cynical
                 view of the law that can perpetuate crime and victimization. 7
                 The people most likely to experience high rates of violence and
                 heavy police presence in their communities have limited
                 resources, 8 social capital, 9 and political voice. 10 Yet
                 their voices, when amplified, can be a powerful tool that
                 communities can leverage to hold law enforcement accountable.
                 Integrating the authentic experiences and perceptions of
                 community members into public safety decisionmaking processes
                 is critical in efforts to promote public safety. 11 Quite
                 simply, reductions in violent crime are not possible without
                 meaningful representation of-and engagement with-the residents
                 most affected by it. 12 This research brief aims to elevate the
                 experiences, views, and attitudes of residents often
                 underrepresented in research on perceptions of law

              much bias is present when a lagged dependent variable is used

               and endogeneity problems. It accommodates heterogeneity across
               units and between time periods in the form of random intercepts
               and random-effect coefficients. At the same time, its p th-order
               autoregressive error process, employed either by itself or in
               concert with other dynamic methods, adequately corrects serial
               correlation and improves statistical inference and forecasting.
               With a stationarity restriction on the error process, the model
               can also be used as a residual-based cointegration test on
               discrete TSCS data. This is especially valuable because
               cointegration testing on discrete TSCS data is methodologically

              agree with the need for modeling time dependence, we demonstrate
              that time dummies can induce estimation problems due to
              separation. Splines do not suffer from these problems. However,
              the complexity of splines has led substantive researchers (1) to
              use knot values that may be inappropriate for their data and (2)
              to ignore any substantive discussion concerning temporal
              dependence. We propose a relatively simple alternative: including
              t, t2, and t3 in the regression. This cubic polynomial
              approximation is trivial to implement-and, therefore,
              interpret-and it avoids problems such as quasi-complete

              formation of policy attitudes that we validate using a distinctive
              opinion survey of our own design, fielded not long after the onset
              of the Great Recession. The survey tracks citizens' economic
              experiences, expectations, and policy attitudes within multiple
              domains of risk (employment, medical care, family, and wealth
              arrangements). These investigations show that economic insecurity
              systematically and substantially affects citizens' attitudes
              toward government's role. Citizens' economic worries largely track
              exposure to substantial economic shocks. Citizens' policy
              attitudes in turn appear highly responsive to economic worries, as
              well as to the experience of economic shocks-with worries and
              shocks creating greater support for government policies that
              buffer the relevant economic risk. Attitudes seem most affected by
              temporally proximate shocks, shocks befalling households that have
              weak private safety nets, and shocks occurring within the domain
              most relevant to the policy in question, though attitudes are also
              (more weakly) correlated with shocks in other domains. The
              magnitude of these associations rivals partisanship and ideology
              and almost always exceeds that for conventional measures of
              socio-economic status. Given the long-term increase in economic
              insecurity and current sluggish recovery, understanding how
              insecurity shapes citizens' policy attitudes and political
              behavior should be a major concern of political science. © 2013

              wrangling of categorical data is an important component of this

              data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with
              collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper
              discusses common problems arising from categorical variable
              transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and
              suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each
              problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in
              base R and the other from the 'tidyverse.' We consider several
              motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and
              outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality

              polls suffer from a variety of sampling and non-sampling errors,

              margins of error typically only capture sampling variability, and
              in particular, generally ignore non-sampling errors in defining
              the target popula-tion (e.g., errors due to uncertainty in who
              will vote). Here we empirically analyze 4,221 polls for 608
              state-level presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections
              be-tween 1998 and 2014, all of which were conducted during the
              final three weeks of the campaigns. Comparing to the actual
              election outcomes, we find that average survey error as measured
              by root mean square error (RMSE) is approximately 3.5 percentage
              points, about twice as large as that implied by most reported
              margins of error. Using hierarchical Bayesian latent variable
              models, we decompose survey error into election-level bias and
              variance terms. We find average absolute election-level bias is
              about 1.5 percentage points, indicating that polls for a given
              election often share a common com-ponent of error. This shared
              error may stem from the fact that polling organizations often face
              similar difficulties in reaching various subgroups of the
              population, and rely on similar screening rules when estimating
              who will vote. We further find that aver-age election-level

              which is premised on research on the policy-making process showing
              that space on the political agenda and, ultimately, policy change
              are more likely to arise in response to changes in both public

              alternative frames should be evaluated based on their consequences
              for both. This is especially critical given that frames can have
              divergent effects on attitudes and behavior. Using a combination

              assessing the potential influence of unmeasured confounding on
              causal conclusions. However, previous sensitivity analysis
              approaches often make strong and untestable assumptions such as
              having an unmeasured confounder that is binary, or having no
              interaction between the effects of the exposure and the confounder
              on the outcome, or having only one unmeasured confounder. Without
              imposing any assumptions on the unmeasured confounder or
              confounders, we derive a bounding factor and a sharp inequality
              such that the sensitivity analysis parameters must satisfy the
              inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to explain away the

              previous sensitivity analysis techniques that do make assumptions.
              Our new bounding factor implies not only the traditional cornfield

              between the covariates and the outcome and use those relationships

               common situation on many political issues—leads to the
               preeminence of early frames and the rejection of later frames.
               Instead of opinion decay, we find dogmatic adherence to opinions

              support as relatively fixed. Using a series of survey experiments,

              the Court should be independent from the elected branches.
              Specifically, we find partisan source cues play a significant role
              in shaping public opinion regarding life tenure for the justices
              and the extent to which the Court should have the final say in

              identical to the treatment group in terms of the pattern of
              self-selection. Second, the randomized-out control group does not
              participate in the program, so the impact of the program on them
              is known to be zero. Thus, a nonexperimental estimator applied to
              the control-group data combined with the nonexperimental
              comparison group data should, if consistent, produce an estimated

              Demonstration, a labor training program, on postintervention
              earnings. We use data from Lalonde's evaluation of nonexperimental
              methods that combine the treated units from a randomized
              evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison units drawn
              from survey datasets. We apply propensity score methods to this
              composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative to the estimators
              that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score estimates of the
              treatment impact are much closer to the experimental benchmark
              estimate. Propensity score methods assume that the variables
              associated with assignment to treatment are observed (referred to
              as ignorable treatment assignment, or selection on observables).
              Even under this assumption, it is difficult to control for
              differences between the treatment and comparison groups when they
              are dissimilar and when there are many preintervention variables.
              The estimated propensity score (the probability of assignment to
              treatment, conditional on preintervention variables) summarizes
              the preintervention variables. This offers a diagnostic on the
              comparability of the treatment and comparison groups, because one
              has only to compare the estimated propensity score across the two
              groups. We discuss several methods (such as stratification and
              matching) that use the propensity score to estimate the treatment
              impact. When the range of estimated propensity scores of the
              treatment and comparison groups overlap, these methods can
              estimate the treatment impact for the treatment group. A
              sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates are not sensitive to
              the specification of the estimated propensity score, but are
              sensitive to the assumption of selection on observables. We
              conclude that when the treatment and comparison groups overlap,
              and when the variables determining assignment to treatment are
              observed, these methods provide a means to estimate the treatment
              impact. Even though propensity score methods are not always
              applicable, they offer a diagnostic on the quality of
              nonexperimental comparison groups in terms of observable

              public demand for more severe sentencing is one of the
              justifications for mandatory sentences of imprisonment. In
              addition, politicians use mandatory sentencing legislation to

               we viewed as robust and central to these disciplines are
               unreplicable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication\_crisis).
               The research in medicine is associated with one scientist-John
               Ioannidis, now at Stanford University. He has published several
               widely cited publications demonstrating that a number of
               ostensibly robust findings of clinical trials are not replicable
               (Ioannidis 2005a, b). In one study (2005b) he reviewed 45 highly
               cited studies; 13 had no replication studies, of the remainder,
               20 (61\%) replicated. While interesting and disturbing because of
               the real impact (positive or negative) of these interventions on
               health, the findings are likely of peripheral interest to
               educators. However, lack of replicability in psychology is much
               closer to home. There have been a number of papers and articles
               raising issues about the extent to which results in psychology
               can be replicated. At the extreme, there have been several high
               profile exposures of scientific fraud. Perhaps the most egregious
               is Diederik Stapel, a social psychologist then at Tilburg, who
               made a lifetime career of fabricating data
               (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Diederik\_Stapel). At last count
               he has been forced to retract 58 publications. One has to hope
               that such practices are rare. However a more prevalent occurrence
               is that findings that were thought to be robust cannot be
               reproduced. Some examples: Dijksterhuis et al. (2006) achieved
               fame (and the inevitable Science article Dijk-sterhuis and Van
               Olden 2006) with something called the ''Deliberation without

               in other ways. Care in the choice of circumstances in which the
               study is conducted can greatly influence the quality of the
               evidence about treatment effects. This is illustrated in detail
               using three observational studies that use choice effectively,
               one each from economics, clinical psychology and epidemiology.
               Other studies are discussed more briefly to illustrate specific
               points. The design choices include (i) the choice of research
               hypothesis, (ii) the choice of treated and control groups, (iii)
               the explicit use of competing theories, rather than merely null
               and alternative hypotheses, (iv) the use of internal replication
               in the form of multiple manipulations of a single dose of
               treatment, (v) the use of undelivered doses in control groups,
               (vi) design choices to minimize the need for stability analyses,

              measurements, sometimes called time-series cross-sectional (TSCS)
              data, allow researchers to estimate a broad set of causal
              quantities, including contemporaneous and lagged treatment
              effects. Unfortunately, popular methods for TSCS data can only
              produce valid inferences for lagged effects under very strong
              assumptions. In this paper, we use potential outcomes to define
              causal quantities of interest in this settings and clarify how
              standard models like the autoregressive distributed lag model can
              produce biased estimates of these quantities due to post-treatment
              conditioning. We then describe two estimation strategies that
              avoid these post-treatment biases—inverse probability weighting
              and structural nested mean models—and show via simulations that
              they can outperform standard approaches in small sample settings.

               difference between within and between effects of predictor
               variables is important in considering what modelling strategy to
               use. We show that the main problem of Random Effects modelling -
               endogenous variables - is in fact a case of omitted variable bias
               that is readily solvable using a variant of the Mundlak (1978a)
               formulation. Consequently, Random Effects modelling provides
               everything that Fixed Effects modelling promises, and much more.
               Crucially it allows the modelling of time-invariant variables,
               and does so in a more parsimonious and explicit way than an
               alternative, Plümper and Troegers Fixed Effects Vector
               Decomposition (2007). It is also readily extendable to a Random
               Coefficients Model, allowing reliable, differential effects of
               variables without heavy parameterisation. As such we are arguing
               not simply for a technical solution to endogeneity, but for the
               substantive importance of modelling context, and the ability of
               Random Effects modelling to do so. Our empirical examples then
               show that failing to do this can lead to very misleading results.
               The distinctive focus of this paper is the stress on the
               substantive interpretation of the within and between relations.
               This has implications that extend beyond the realm of political

              designs. Yet, all theories of inference pro-posed to justify
              matching methods are based on simple random sampling. This is all
              the more troubling because, although these theories require exact
              matching, most matching applications resort to some form of ex
              post stratification (on a propensity score, distance metric, or
              the covariates) to find approximate matches, thus nulli-fying the
              statistical properties the theories are designed to ensure.
              Fortunately, the type of sampling used in a theory of inference is
              an axiom, rather than an assump-tion vulnerable to being proven
              wrong, and so we can replace simple with stratified sampling, so
              long as we can show, as we do here, that the implications of the

              were investigated: relative risk reductions, absolute risk
              reductions, and number needed to treat or screen. METHODS: A
              systematic review of the published literature was conducted.
              Articles were retrieved by searching a variety of databases and
              screened for inclusion by 2 reviewers. Data were extracted on
              characteristics of the subjects and methodologies used. Log-odds
              ratios were calculated to estimate effect sizes. RESULTS: A total
              of 24 articles were retrieved that reported on 31 unique
              experiments. The meta-analysis showed that treatments were
              evaluated more favorably when the relative risk format was used
              rather than the absolute risk or number needed to treat format.
              However, a significant amount of heterogeneity was found between
              studies, the sources of which were explored using subgroup
              analyses and metaregression. Although the subgroup analyses
              revealed smaller effect sizes in the studies conducted on
              physicians, the metaregression showed that these differences were
              largely accounted for by other features of the study design. Most
              notably, variations in effect sizes were explained by the
              particular wordings that the studies had chosen to use for the
              relative risk and absolute risk reductions. CONCLUSIONS: The
              published literature has consistently demonstrated that relative
              risk formats produce more favorable evaluations of treatments than
              absolute risk or number needed to treat formats. However, the
              effects are heterogeneous and seem to be moderated by key
              differences between the methodologies used.",

               the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems

               power, researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on
               publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a
               contentious debate about the extent to which failures to
               reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual
               differences (often termed ``hidden moderators'') between the
               original research and the replication attempt. Although
               psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual
               factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely
               to influence the results of direct replications precisely because
               these studies use the same methods as those used in the original
               research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100
               original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent
               to which the research topic of each study was contextually
               sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of
               the research topic was associated with replication success, even
               after statistically adjusting for several methodological
               characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The

              actors are boundedly rational and this impacts upon the way in

              bounded rationality applies equally to the production of evidence.

              firms, we analyze the impact of automatic enrollment on 401(k)
              participation rates, savings behavior, and asset accumulation. We
              find that although employees can opt out of the 401(k) plan, few
              choose to do so. As a result, automatic enrollment has a dramatic
              impact on retirement savings behavior: 401(k) participation rates
              at all three firms exceed 85\%, but participants tend to anchor at
              a low default savings rate and in a conservative default
              investment vehicle. We find that initially, about 80\% of
              participants accept both the default savings rate (2\% or 3\% for
              our three companies) and the default investment fund (a stable
              value or money market fund). Even after three years, half of the
              plan participants subject to automatic enrollment continue to
              contribute at the default rate and invest their contributions
              exclusively in the default fund. The effects of automatic
              enrollment on asset accumulation are not straightforward. While
              higher participation rates promote wealth accumulation, the low
              default savings rate and the conservative default investment fund
              undercut accumulation. In our sample, these two effects are
              roughly offsetting on average. However, automatic enrollment does
              increase saving in the lower tail of the savings distribution by
              dramatically reducing the fraction of employees who do not

               taxes or subsidies. This paper studies the optimal choice of
               policy instrument in settings characterized by such features. We
               utilize a simple binary-choice model in which decision-makers are
               either active or passive; active choosers make their decisions by
               com-paring perceived costs and benefits whereas passive choosers
               select whichever option is the default. From this simple model, a
               number of results emerge. First, manipulating the default option
               is preferable to imposing a mandate when active choosers tend to
               make correct deci-sions. Second, taxes and defaults are
               complements, not substitutes; employing the two types of
               instruments in conjunction can yield better results than
               utilizing either one alone. Finally, the optimal combination of
               taxes and defaults is typically preferable to a mandate even in
               settings where active choosers are prone to biases. The results

              When asked, they say they prefer a 'green' (i.e., environmentally

              is available in many markets, people do not generally buy it. Why

              present two natural studies and two experiments in the laboratory
              that support this hypothesis. In the two real-world situations,
              there was a green default, and most people used it. In the first
              laboratory experiment, more participants chose the green utility
              when it was the default than when 'grey' electricity was the
              default. In the second laboratory experiment, participants asked
              for more money to give up green electricity than they were willing

               based on and propose an alternative framework that helps to
               classify nudges into two types (Type 1 and Type 2). We then
               evaluate the evidence for nudges in the health domain, drawing
               attention to critical empirical issues (internal and external
               reliability) that explain the limited evidence base for their
               effectiveness. The review ends with an examination of the

               evidence on public attitudes to expertise offers some hope that

               actually under-researched. Not only are Ministers open to
               evidence, but there is an institutional grounding for
               evidence-based policy in government. Meanwhile, the creation of
               devolved institutions has created new sites in the UK for

               those who advise them in the evidence-promoting capacity of the
               academic policy community, and shaping the wider authorising

              studies may have significantly underestimated the effect of these
              outlets. We also illustrate that how the two-step communication
              flow works is contingent upon the precise composition of the
              discussion group (e.g., is it consistent of all fellow partisans
              or a mix of partisans?). We conclude by highlighting what our

              partisan polarization."

              functions of government, which include remedying market failures,
              redistributing income, and collecting tax revenue. An
              understanding of psychology can also lead to the development of
              different policy tools that better motivate desired behavior
              change or that are more cost-effective than traditional policy
              tools. The article outlines a framework for thinking about the
              psychology of behavior change in the context of market fail-ures.
              It then describes the research on the effects of a variety of
              interven-tions rooted in an understanding of psychology that have
              policy-relevant applications. The article concludes by discussing
              how an understanding of psychology can also inform the use and
              design of traditional policy tools for behavior change, such as
              financial incentives. A lot of our policy models traditionally are
              based on a rather naïve understanding of what drives behavior. But
              if you have a more intelligent, nuanced account of how people make
              decisions, you can design policy that is more effective, less
              costly, and makes life easier for most citizens. —David Halpern,

               '' Such effects are docu-mented in the literature on 401(k) plans
               (see Madrian and Dennis Shea, 2001; Choi et al., 2002, 2003b).
               Defaults affect 401(k) participation, savings rates, rollovers,
               and asset allocation. For example, when employees are
               automati-cally enrolled in their 401(k) plan, only a tiny
               fraction opt out, producing nearly 100-percent enrollment. But
               when employees are not auto-matically enrolled, less than half
               enroll on their own during their first year of employment.
               Defaults matter for three key reasons mod-eled in this paper.
               First, acts of commission (e.g., opting out of a default) are
               costly. Second, these costs vary over time, generating an option
               value of waiting for a low-cost period to opt out. Third, people
               are susceptible to procrasti-nation. Even if they want to make a
               change, they have a tendency to delay that change longer than
               they should. These three effects imply that the choice of
               defaults can have sig-nificant welfare consequences. If all
               employees share a common optimal savings rate, selecting an
               optimal default is triv-ial. But the calculation of an optimal
               default is not straightforward if employees have heteroge-neous
               optimal savings rates. In such a world, it may sometimes be
               optimal to set defaults that are far away from the mean optimal
               savings rate. This effect arises for two reasons. First, a
               default that is far from a procrastinating em-ployee's optimal
               savings rate may make the employee better off than a default that
               is closer to the employee's optimal savings rate. A `` bad ''
               default is more likely to motivate opting out than a good but
               imperfect default, potentially overcoming procrastination and
               improving the agent's welfare. Second, our theory implies that
               optimal defaults are highly sensitive to the ac-tual distribution
               of optimal savings rates. In particular, optimal defaults are
               often associated with the modal optimal savings rate, which is
               sometimes extreme (e.g., the plan's minimum or maximum
               contribution rate). At the end of our paper, we illustrate these
               effects with cal-culations of optimal defaults for employees at
               four different companies.",

              plan within a large university. The experi-ment encouraged a
              random sample of employees in a subset of departments to attend a
              benefits information fair organized by the university, by
              promising a monetary reward for attendance. The experiment
              multiplied by more than five the attendance rate of these treated
              individuals (relative to controls), and tripled that of untreated
              individuals within departments where some individuals were
              treated. TDA enrollment five and eleven months after the fair was
              significantly higher in departments where some individuals were
              treated than in departments where nobody was treated. However, the
              effect on TDA enrollment is almost as large for individuals in
              treated departments who did not receive the encourage-ment as for
              those who did. We provide three interpretations— differential
              treat-ment effects, social network effects, and motivational
              reward effects—to account for these results."

              policy issues, the strength of ideological self-placement, or a

              underscore the power of partisan identity to generate
              action-oriented emotions that drive campaign activity. Strongly
              identified partisans feel angrier than weaker partisans when
              threatened with electoral loss and more positive when reassured of

              sustainable and raises problems with its wide scope involving
              diverse actors. Moreover, in the face of demographic change and a
              growing global population, sus-tainability problems arising from
              food systems will likely become more serious in the future. For
              example, agricultural production must deal with the impacts of
              climate change, increasingly challenging land-use conflicts, and
              rising health and social costs on both individual and societal
              levels. The unsustainability of current arrangements arises from
              the industrialization and globalization of agriculture and food
              processing, the shift of consumption patterns toward more dietary
              animal protein, the emergence of modern food styles that entail
              heavily processed products, the growing gap on a global scale
              between rich and poor, and the paradoxical lack of food security
              amid an abundance of food. These factors are attributable to
              national and international policies and regulations, as well as to
              prevalent business prac-tices and, in particular, consumers'
              values and habits. The most effective ways for affluent societies
              to reduce the environmental impact of their diets are to reduce
              consumption of meat and dairy products (especially beef), to favor
              organic fruits and vegetables, and to avoid goods that have been
              transported by air on both individual and institu-tional levels
              (e.g., public procurement, public catering). In examining the
              unsustainability of the current food system this article reviews
              the pertinent literature to derive a working definition of
              sustainable food consumption, outlines the major issues and
              impacts of current food-consumption practices, and discusses

              instruments, market-based initiatives, direct regulations, and ``

              foundations (Authority, Respect, and Purity). We argue these

              Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ECT) as an alternative,
              explaining how competitive dynamics in the ancestral social
              environment could produce the observed ideological differences. We
              test ECT against MFT across three studies. Study 1 shows the
              so-called `` binding '' orientation entails the threat-sensitivity
              and outgroup antagonism predicted by ECT; that is, an
              authoritarian motive. Similarly, Study 2 shows the so-called ``
              individualizing '' orientation is better described as a
              universalizing motive, one reflecting a broader set of moral
              commitments (e.g., to nature) and a broader sociality than the
              egocentrism implied by MFT. Study 3 provides a factor analysis
              reducing `` binding '' to authoritarianism and `` individualizing
              '' to universalism, with the latter loading against social
              dominance orientation (SDO). A hierarchical regression then
              provides additional evidence for ECT, showing this dominating
              motive (SDO) accounts for variance in conservatism that MFT leaves
              unexplained. Collectively, these three studies suggest that ECT
              offers a more accurate and precise explanation of the key
              psychological differences between liberals and conservatives.",

              to various models of decision making and rational judgment (e.g.,
              the basic axioms of utility theory). This gap between the
              normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating
              systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four
              alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human
              behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the

              limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter,
              and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. In the

              Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational
              limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks,
              particularly those that involve some type of cognitive
              decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest

              desirability and political acceptability of randomized trials
              (RCTs) outside medicine. For many working in medical research, it
              can seem pe-culiar that randomized trials are resisted in other
              fields. There are frequently situations in education, policing,
              criminal justice, employment and other areas of policy where RCTs
              could be practical and informative, especially: where there is
              arbitrary variation in the use of a particular intervention; where
              there are broadly reliable and valid outcomes to be measured; and
              where strong claims for ef-fectiveness are being made. Trials
              outside medicine have, however, been slow to come. The prospect of
              an RCT on beating children provides a good—if extreme, and
              rhet-orically dangerous—opportunity to explore the broader
              objections to RCTs outside medicine. First, it is important to
              note that the attached paper was not a randomized controlled trial
              of caning. This was not for want of trying. In fact the work by
              Palmer on caning is mentioned twice, in passing, by Archie
              Cochrane in his 1972 monograph Effectiveness and Efficiency, 1 one
              of the founding documents of evidence-based medicine (it is also
              discussed at some length in Cochrane's autobiography). 2 Initially
              he uses the paper to illustrate the weaknesses of data from
              research into the effectiveness of interventions where
              participants are not randomized: Observational evidence is never
              very satisfactory. An example comes from Palmer's work in my own
              unit…He took very detailed smoking histories from all the boys in
              a secondary modern school on two occa-sions, one year apart. He
              then obtained a list of all the boys who had been caned for
              smoking during that period. He was thus able to compare 'change in
              smok-ing habit' in caned and uncaned boys. The results ap-pear at
              first very striking. Those caned increased their cigarette
              consumption significantly more than those who were not caned, but
              when one thinks about it the results do not tell us anything at
              all. They are equally compatible with caning increasing,
              decreasing, or hav-ing no effect on cigarette consumption.
              Observational evidence is clearly better than opinion, but it is
              thor-oughly unsatisfactory.",

              these distinctions and characterizes the resulting systems in
              light of recent findings and theoretical developments. One system
              is associative because its computations reflect similarity
              structure and relations of temporal contiguity. The other is
              ``rule based'' because it operates on symbolic structures that
              have logical content and variables and because its computations
              have the properties that are normally assigned to rules. The
              systems serve complementary functions and can simultaneously
              generate different solutions to a reasoning problem. The
              rule-based system can suppress the associative system but not
              completely inhibit it. The article reviews evidence in favor of
              the distinction and its characterization. One of the oldest
              conundrums in psychology is whether peo-ple are best conceived as
              parallel processors of information who operate along diffuse
              associative links or as analysts who operate by deliberate and
              sequential manipulation of internal represen-tations. Are
              inferences drawn through a network of learned as-sociative
              pathways or through application of a kind of ``psycho-logic'' that
              manipulates symbolic tokens in a rule-governed way? The debate has
              raged (again) in cognitive psychology for almost a decade now. It
              has pitted those who prefer models of mental phenomena to be built
              out of networks of associative devices that pass activation around
              in parallel and distributed form (the way brains probably
              function) against those who pre-fer models built out of formal
              languages in which symbols are composed into sentences that are
              processed sequentially (the way computers function). An obvious
              solution to the conundrum is to conceive of the mind both ways—to
              argue that the mind has dual aspects, one of which conforms to the
              associationistic view and one of which conforms to the analytic,
              sequential view. Such a dichotomy has its appeal: Associative
              thoughtfeels like it arises from a different cognitive mechanism
              than does deliberate, analytical reasoning. Sometimes conclusions
              simply appear at some level of aware-ness, as if the mind goes
              off, does some work, and then comes back with a result, and
              sometimes coming to a conclusion re-quires doing the work oneself,
              making an effort to construct a chain of reasoning. Given an
              arithmetic problem, such as fig-uring out change at the cash
              register, sometimes the answer springs to mind associatively, and
              sometimes a person has to do mental arithmetic by analyzing the
              amounts involved and operating on the resultant components as
              taught to do in school.",

              Phys. Rev. E 62, 1 (2000) 961-974]. For small size ratios
              (typically15): large beads are close to the bottom in a reversing
              position. The existence of circles with an intermediate radius
              shows that the segregation at an intermediate level within a flow
              is possible. In this paper, we experimentally study the
              segregation of particles of different densities and sizes in a
              half-filled rotating drum and other devices (chute flow, pile). In
              the drum, the location of the segregated ring continuously varies
              from the periphery to the center and is very sensitive to both the
              size (from 1 to 33) and density (from 0.36 to 4.8) ratios. The
              densest large beads segregate on a circle close to the center, the
              lightest large beads on a circle close to the periphery.
              Consequently, we found that for any tracer, its excess of mass,
              due to only a size excess, a density excess, or both, leads to a
              deep inside segregation of the tracer. There is a push-away
              process that makes heavy beads of any type go downwards, while the
              excess of size is already known to push large beads towards the
              surface, by a dynamical sieving process. Each segregation at an
              intermediate ring corresponds to a balance between these mass and
              geometrical effects. The segregation level in the flow is
              determined by the ratio of the intensities of both effects.",

              Theory integration is a longstanding concern in biology,
              economics, or physics, but not in psy-chology. We teach our
              students how to test theories, not the art of theory construction
              in the first place. As a consequence, in some parts of
              psychol-ogy, theories have become replaced by surrogates, such as
              circular restate-ments of the phenomenon, one-word explanations,
              and lists of general dichotomies. Moving backwards from existing
              models to labels is an odd event in science, which typically
              progresses in the opposite direction. Theory construction should
              be taught in graduate school, and editors of major journals should
              encourage submissions that make advances in theory integration.

              When discussing psychological research, what surprises every
              economist or physicist is that psychology has no theory. It has
              many local ones but no overarching theory, not even a provisional
              one. Yet there is something even more surprising: a lack of
              awareness of the value of integration. Whereas the unification of
              theories, such as evolutionary theory and genetics, is a widely
              shared goal in physics and biology, it is barely visible in
              psychology. Few psychologists even consider theory integration as
              an objective. A textbook in economics starts with first principles
              that lead to an overarching theory and discusses how reality fits

              utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under
              risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory.
              Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects
              that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In
              particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable
              in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This
              tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk
              aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in
              choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally
              discard components that are shared by all prospects under
              consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads
              to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in
              different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in
              which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final
              assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision
              weights. The value function is normally concave for gains,
              commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses
              than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the
              corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low
              prob-abilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute

               learned how to work with a wide range of implementing

               large government bureaucracies. They improved data collection

              the social influence liter-ature, focusing primarily on compliance
              and conformity research published between 1997 and 2002. The
              principles and processes underlying a target's susceptibility to
              out-side influences are considered in light of three goals
              fundamental to rewarding human functioning. Specifically, targets
              are motivated to form accurate perceptions of reality and react
              accordingly, to develop and preserve meaningful social
              relationships, and to maintain a favorable self-concept.
              Consistent with the current movement in compliance and conformity
              research, this review emphasizes the ways in which these goals
              interact with external forces to engender social influence
              processes that are subtle, indirect, and outside of awareness.",

              been identified that generate attitude change and resistance.
              These involve concerns with the self, with others and the
              rewards/punishments they can provide, and with a valid

              dependent variables that measure the number of times some event
              occurs. Counts of international events are probably the most
              common, but numerous examples exist in every empirical field of
              the discipline. The results of the analysis below strongly suggest
              that the way event counts have been analyzed in hundreds of
              important political science studies have produced statisti- cally

              inefficiency, bias, inconsistency, insuffi- ciency, and other
              problems result from the unknowing application of two common
              methods that are without theoretical justification or empirical
              utility in this type of data. I show that the exponential Poisson

              Obesity was defined as body mass index >or= 30 kg/m(2). The data
              were arranged as a panel with multiple observations per
              individual, and the models of obesity included current and
              long-term FSP participation, additional demographic, socioeconomic
              and environment characteristics and individual fixed effects.
              Individual fixed effects were used to take into account unobserved
              differences across individuals that did not vary over time. In
              ordinary least squares models, current and long-term FSP
              participation were significantly related to the obesity of low
              income women (P < 0.05), but not of low income men. For low income
              women, current participation in the FSP was associated with a
              9.1\% increase in the predicted probability of current obesity.
              Participation in the FSP in each of the previous five years
              compared to no participation over that time period was associated
              with approximately a 20.5\% increase in the predicted probability
              of current obesity. These models did not control for food
              insecurity, and this omission potentially complicates the

              the validity of behavioral economics as an alter-native paradigm
              continues to be debated. The debate about behavioral economics is
              often framed as a question about the founda-tional assumptions of
              neoclassical economics. Are individuals rational? Do they optimize
              in market settings? This debate has proved to be contentious, with
              compelling arguments in favor 1 Although the implications of
              psychology for economics have been formalized using mathematical

              (e.g., List 2004; Levitt and List 2007; DellaVigna 2009). In this
              paper, I approach the debate on behavioral economics from a more
              pragmatic, policy-oriented perspective. Instead of pos-ing the
              central research question as `` Are the assumptions of the
              neoclassical economic model valid?, '' the pragmatic approach
              starts from a policy question (for example, `` How can we increase
              savings rates? '') and incorpo-rates behavioral factors to the
              extent that they improve empirical predictions and policy
              deci-sions. 2 This approach follows the widely applied methodology
              of positive economics advocated by Friedman (1953), who argued
              that it is more useful to evaluate economic models on the
              accu-racy of their empirical predictions than on their
              assumptions. 3 While Friedman used this reason-ing to argue in
              favor of neoclassical models, I argue that modern evidence calls
              for incorpo-rating behavioral economics into the analysis of
              important economic questions. I classify the implications of
              behavioral eco-nomics for public policy into three domains. Each
              of these domains has a long intellectual tradition in economics,
              showing that from a pragmatic perspective, behavioral economics
              represents a natural progression of (rather than a challenge to)
              neoclassical economic methods. First, behavioral economics offers
              new pol-icy tools that can be used to influence behavior.",

               insurance available to them-many at very low cost-but do not take
               it up. Traditional economic analysis is based on the premise that
               these are rational decisions, but it is hard to reconcile
               observed enrollment patterns with this view. The policy
               prescriptions that the traditional model generates may thus fail
               to achieve their goals. Behavioral economics, which integrates
               insights from psychology into economic analysis, identifies
               important deviations from the traditional assumptions of
               rationality and can thus improve our understanding of what drives
               health insurance take-up and improved policy design. METHODS:
               Rather than a systematic review of the coverage literature, this
               article is a primer for considering issues in health insurance
               coverage from a behavioral economics perspective, supplementing
               the standard model. We present relevant evidence on decision
               making and insurance take-up and use it to develop a behavioral
               approach to both the policy problem posed by the lack of health
               insurance coverage and possible policy solutions to that problem.
               FINDINGS: We found that evidence from behavioral economics can
               shed light on both the sources of low take-up and the efficacy of
               different policy levers intended to expand coverage. We then
               applied these insights to policy design questions for public and
               private insurance coverage and to the implementation of the
               recently enacted health reform, focusing on the use of behavioral
               insights to maximize the value of spending on coverage.
               CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the success of health insurance
               coverage reform depends crucially on understanding the behavioral
               barriers to take-up. The take-up process is likely governed by
               psychology as much as economics, and public resources can likely
               be used much more effectively with behaviorally informed policy
               design.",

              However, defaults may increase the scope for evasion if set

               stress randomization-based inference as opposed to sampling-based
               inference. In randomization-based inference, uncertainty in
               estimates arises naturally from the random assignment of the
               treatments, rather than from hypothesized sampling from a large
               population. We show how this perspective relates to regression
               analyses for randomized experiments. We discuss the analyses of
               stratified, paired, and clustered randomized experiments, and we
               stress the general efficiency gains from stratification. We also
               discuss complications in randomized experiments such as
               non-compliance. In the presence of non-compliance we contrast
               intention-to-treat analyses with instrumental variables analyses

               in detail estimation and inference for heterogeneous treatment

               in people's lives are subject to essentially the same questions
               about acceptability and effectiveness. As the social reformers
               Sidney and Beatrice Webb pointed out in 1932, there is far more
               experimentation going on in “the world sociological laboratory in
               which we all live” than in any other kind of laboratory, but most
               of this social experimentation is “wrapped in secrecy” and thus
               yields “nothing to science.”1 \#\#\# Summary points Many social
               scientists argue that randomised controlled trials are
               inappropriate for evaluating social interventions, but they
               ignore a considerable history, mainly in the United States, of
               the use of randomised controlled trials to assess different
               approaches to public policy and health promotion A tradition of
               experimental sociology was well established by the 1930s, built
               on the early use of controlled experiments in psychology and
               education From the early 1960s to early 1980s randomised
               experiments were considered the optimal design for evaluating
               public policy interventions in the United States, and major
               evaluations using this design were carried out This approach
               became less popular as policy makers reacted negatively to
               evidence of “near zero” effects Lessons to be learnt about
               implementing randomised controlled trials in real life settings
               include the difficulty of assessing complex multi-level
               interventions and the challenge of integrating qualitative data
               The Webbs argued for a more “scientific” social policy, with
               social scientists being trained in experimental methods and
               evaluations of social interventions being carried out by
               independent investigators. They were apparently unaware that a

              way to tell whether a program works at scale is to test it at
              scale. Our goal in this paper is to propose a way out of this
              Catch-22. We first develop a simple model that helps clarify the
              type of scale-up challenge for which our method is most relevant.
              Most social programs rely on labor as a key input (teachers,
              nurses, social workers, etc.). We know people vary greatly in
              their skill at these jobs. So social programs, like firms,
              confront a search problem in the labor market that can lead to
              inelastically-supplied human capital. The result is that as
              programs scale, either average costs must increase if program
              quality is to be held constant, or else program quality will
              decline if average costs are held fixed. Our proposed method for
              reducing the costs of estimating program impacts at large scale
              combines the fact that hiring inherently involves ranking inputs
              with the most powerful element of the social science toolkit:
              randomization. We show that it is possible to operate a program at
              modest scale n but learn about the input supply curves facing the
              firm at much larger scale (S × n) by randomly sampling the inputs
              the provider would have hired if they operated at scale (S × n).
              We build a simple two-period model of social-program decision
              making and use a model of Bayesian learning to develop heuristics
              for when scale-up experiments of the sort we propose are likely to
              be particularly valuable. We also present a series of results to
              illustrate the method, including one application to a real-world
              tutoring program that highlights an interesting observation: The
              noisier the program provider's prediction of input quality, the
              less pronounced is the scale-up problem.",

               communities worldwide. An influential study conducted in Kenya in
               1998-99 reported that a school-based drug-and-educational
               intervention had benefits regarding worm infections and school
               attendance. Effects were seen among children treated with
               deworming drugs, untreated children in intervention schools and
               children in nearby non-intervention schools. Combining these
               effects, the intervention was reported to increase school
               attendance by 7.5\% in treated children. Effects on other
               outcomes (worm infections, anaemia, nutritional status and
               examination performance) were also investigated. METHODS In this
               pure replication, we used data provided by the original authors
               to re-analyse the study according to their methods. We compared
               these results against those presented in the original paper.
               RESULTS Although most results were reproduced as originally
               reported, we identified discrepancies of several types between
               the original findings and re-analysis. For worm infections,
               re-analysis showed reductions similar to those originally
               reported. For anaemia prevalence, in contrast to the original
               findings, re-analysis found no evidence of benefit. For
               nutritional status, both original findings and re-analysis
               described modest evidence for a small improvement. For school
               attendance, re-analysis showed benefits similar to those
               originally found in intervention schools for both children who
               did and those who did not receive deworming drugs. However, after
               correction of coding errors, there was little evidence of an
               indirect effect on school attendance among children in schools
               close to intervention schools. Combining these effects gave a
               total increase in attendance of 3.9\% among treated children,
               which was no longer statistically significant. As in the original
               results, re-analysis found no effect of the intervention on
               examination performance. CONCLUSIONS Re-applying analytical
               approaches originally used, but correcting various errors, we
               found little evidence for some previously-reported indirect
               effects of a deworming intervention. Effects on worm infections,
               nutritional status, examination performance and school attendance
               on children in intervention schools were largely unchanged.",

              trial, we find that transfer recipients have higher levels of
              asset holdings, consumption, food security and psychological
              well-being relative to non-recipients in the same village. The
              effects are similar in magnitude to those observed in a previous
              study nine months after the beginning of the program. Comparing
              recipient households to non-recipients in distant villages, we
              find that transfer recipients have 40\% more assets (USD 422 PPP)
              than control households three years after the transfer, equivalent
              to 60\% of the initial transfer (USD 709 PPP). In contrast, other
              outcomes do not show significant treatment effects in the
              across-village analysis, possibly owing to lower power and
              within-village spillovers. We do find some spillover effects.
              Households impacted by spillovers have lower consumption and food
              security than pure control households, perhaps due to the sale of
              productive assets. Estimates of spillover effects on other
              outcomes are inconclusive due to differential attrition between
              spillover and pure control households. We also find little
              evidence of differential treatment effects depending on the
              transfer design (whether transfers are made men or women, in
              monthly payments or a single lump-sum, or a large or small
              transfer). Thus, cash transfers result in sustained increases in
              assets. Long-term impacts on other dimensions, and potential
              spillover effects, remain to be substantiated by future work.

              cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of
              the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the
              classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater
              errors than do ``rational'' decisions as defined by logic or
              statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions
              of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than
              an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an
              uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (``Which
              heuristics do people use in which situations?'') and the

              politically relevant groups such as gay people, the unemployed or

              differences in the penumbras of various social groups, even ones

               of systematic research (or ‘evi- dence’) into policy development,
               programevaluation and programimprovement. This process is
               consistent with the New Public Management (NPM) emphasis on
               efficiency and effective- ness. Analysis of evidence helps to
               answer the questions ‘what works? and ‘what happens if we change
               these settings?’ Secondly, some of the well known challenges and
               limitations for ‘evidence-based’ policy are outlined. Policy
               decisions emerge from politics, judgement and debate, rather than
               being deduced from empirical analysis. Policy debate and analysis
               involves an interplay between facts, norms and desired actions,
               in which ‘evidence’ is diverse and contestable. Thirdly, the
               article outlines a distinction between technical and negotiated
               approaches to problem-solving. The latter is a prominent feature
               of policy domains rich in ‘network’ approaches, partnering and
               community engagement. Networks and partnerships bring to the
               negotiation table a diversity of stakeholder ‘evidence’, ie,
               relevant information, interpretations and priorities. Finally, it
               is suggested that three types of evidence/perspective are
               especially relevant in the modern era – systematic (‘scientific’)
               research, program man- agement experience (‘practice’), and
               political judgement. What works for program clients is
               intrinsically connected to what works for managers and for
               political leaders. Thus, the prac- tical craft of policy
               development and adjustment involves ‘weaving’ strands of
               information and values as seen through the lens of these three
               key stakeholder groups. There is not one evidence-base but
               several bases. These disparate bodies of knowledge become
               multiple sets of evidence that inform and influence policy rather
               than determine it. Key",

              assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983 critique

              contributing to improved empirical work, including the

              theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact

               suffers from narrow logical norms, that is, a misunderstanding of
               the nature of rational thinking, and from a confirmation
               bias,that is, selective reporting of research. These two flaws
               focus the blame on individuals’ minds rather than on external
               causes, such as industries that spend billions to nudge people
               into unhealthy behavior. I conclude that the claim that we are

               neuro- biological data, and use the model to make predictions

               We then use the model to demonstrate how nudges can both infringe

               ``best available evidence,'' should be differentiated from the
               special collection of data regarded as suitable evidence.
               Although the proposed practice does not seem new, the new
               collection of ``best available'' information has major
               constraints for the care of individual patients.Derived almost
               exclusively from randomized trials and meta-analyses, the data do
               not include many types of treatments or patients seen in clinical
               practice; and the results show comparative efficacy of treatment
               for an ``average'' randomized patient, not for pertinent
               subgroups formed by such cogent clinical features as severity of
               symptoms, illness, co-morbidity, and other clinical nuances. The
               intention-to-treat analyses do not reflect important
               post-randomization events leading to altered treatment; and the
               results seldom provide suitable background data when therapy is
               given prophylactically rather than remedially, or when
               therapeutic advantages are equivocal. Randomized trial
               information is also seldom available for issues in etiology,
               diagnosis, and prognosis, and for clinical decisions that depend
               on pathophysiologic changes, psychosocial factors and support,
               personal preferences of patients, and strategies for giving
               comfort and reassurance.The laudable goal of making clinical
               decisions based on evidence can be impaired by the restricted
               quality and scope of what is collected as ``best available
               evidence.'' The authoritative aura given to the collection,
               however, may lead to major abuses that produce inappropriate

               not coercively reduce freedom of choice. Still we might worry
               that this approach fails to respect individual choice because it
               subversively manipulates individuals, thus contravening their
               personal autonomy. In this article I address two arguments to
               this effect. First, I deny that choice architecture is
               necessarily heteronomous. I explain the reasons we have for
               avoiding heteronomous policy-making and offer a set of four
               conditions for non- heteronomy. I then provide examples of nudges
               that meet these conditions. I argue that these policies are
               capable of respecting and promoting personal autonomy, and show
               this claim to be true across contrasting conceptions of autonomy.
               Second, I deny that choice architecture is disrespectful because
               it is epistemically paternalistic. This critique appears to loom
               large even against non-heteronomous nudges. However, I argue that
               while some of these policies may exhibit epistemically
               paternalistic tendencies, these tendencies do not necessarily
               undermine personal autonomy. Thus, ifwe are to find such policies
               objectionable, we cannot do so on the grounds of respect for
               autonomy.",

               policy makers can apply established tools from the governmental
               toolbox to this end (e.g., laws, regulations, incentives, and
               disincentives). Alternatively, they can employ new tools that
               capitalize on the wealth of knowledge about human behavior and
               behavior change that has been accumulated in the behavioral
               sciences (e.g., psychology and economics). Two contrasting
               approaches to behavior change are nudge policies and boost

               program, but to different degrees: Nudging appears to be more
               adversely affected than boosting does. The article concludes with

               distinct periods of field experimentation that have influenced
               the economics literature. The first might well be thought of as
               the dawn of ``field'' experimentation: the work of Neyman and
               Fisher, who laid the experimental foundation in the 1920s and
               1930s by conceptualizing randomization as an instrument to
               achieve identification via experimentation with agricultural
               plots. The second, the large-scale social experiments conducted
               by government agencies in the mid-twentieth century, moved the
               exploration from plots of land to groups of individuals. More
               recently, the nature and range of field experiments has expanded,
               with a diverse set of controlled experiments being completed
               outside of the typical laboratory environment. With this growth,
               the number and types of questions that can be explored using
               field experiments has grown tremendously. After discussing these
               three distinct phases, we speculate on the future of field
               experimental methods, a future that we envision including a
               strong collaborative effort with outside parties, most
               importantly private entities. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  abstract  = "I agree with Deaton and Cartwright that randomized trials are
               often overrated. There is a strange form of reasoning we often
               see in science, which is the idea that a chain of reasoning is as
               strong as its strongest link. The social science and medical
               research literature is full of papers in which a randomized
               experiment is performed, a statistically significant comparison
               is found, and then story time begins, and continues, and
               continues—as if the rigor from the randomized experiment somehow
               suffuses through the entire analysis. Here are some reasons why
               the results of a randomized trial cannot be taken as representing
               a general discovery: 1. Measurement. A causal effect on a
               surrogate endpoint does not necessarily map to an effect on the
               outcome of interest. Direct measurements also can be problematic
               if there is bias that is correlated with treatment assignment, as
               can occur in medical experiments without blinding or psychology
               experiments in which there is information leakage. 2. Missing
               data. Even a small proportion of dropout or nonresponse can bias
               the estimate of treatment effects, if missingness is correlated
               with outcome and treatment assignment. 3. Extrapolation. The
               participants in a controlled trial are typically not
               representative of the larger population of interest. This causes
               no problem if the treatment effect is constant but can leads to
               bias to the extent that treatment effects are nonlinear and have
               interactions. A related concern is realism: extrapolating from
               often-artificial experimental conditions to the real-world
               settings where the treatment might be applied. 4. Researcher
               degrees of freedom. The many options arising in data coding and
               analysis make it easy for researchers to obtain `` statistically
               significant '' p-values even in the absence of any large and
               consistent underlying effects. The fact that treatment assignment
               has been ran-domized does not protect researchers from this ``
               garden of forking paths '' (Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn, 2011,

              the ballot in 2008 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, using a natural
              experiment based on geography. This form of natural ex-periment
              exploits variation in geography where units in one geographic area

               number of problems and paradoxes inherent in the concept of
               “evidence-based policymaking.” The current conflict over
               evidence-based policymaking parallels a long-standing “paradigm
               war” in social research between positivist, interpretivist, and
               critical approaches. This article draws from this debate in order
               to inform the discussions over the appropriateness of evidence-
               based policymaking and the related question of what is the nature
               of policymaking. The positivist, empiricist worldview that
               underpins the theory and practice of evidence-based medicine
               (EBM) fails to address key elements of the policymaking process.
               In particular, a narrowly “evidence-based” framing of
               policymaking is inherently unable to explore the complex,
               context-dependent, and value-laden way in which competing options
               are negotiated by individuals and interest groups.
               Sociolinguistic tools such as argumentation theory offer
               opportunities for developing richer theories about how
               policymaking happens. Such tools also have potential practical
               application in the policymaking process: by enhancing
               participants’ awareness of their own values and those of others,
               the quality of the collective deliberation that lies at the heart
               of policymaking may itself improve.",

               of 5 side effects: endometrial cancer, blood clotting, cataracts,
               hormonal symptoms, and sexual problems. Presentation format was
               randomly varied in a three factor design: (A) risk information
               was displayed either in pictographs or numeric text; (B)
               presentations either reported total risks with and without

              system, which we dub auto-sklearn, improves on existing AutoML
              methods by automatically taking into account past performance on
              similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models
              evaluated during the optimization. Our system won the first phase

               cross-sectional units (e.g., individual survey respondents)
               appear but once in the data. This poses two serious challenges.
               First, as with PCSTS, autocorrelation threatens inferences.
               However, common solutions like differencing and using a lagged
               dependent variable are not possible with RCS since lags for i
               cannot be used. Second, although RCS designs contain information
               that allows both aggregate- and individual-level analyses,
               available methods?from pooled ordinary least squares to PCSTS to
               time series?force researchers to choose one level of analysis.
               The PCSTS tool kit does not provide an appropriate solution, and
               we offer one here: double filtering with ARFIMA methods to
               account for autocorrelation in longer RCS followed by the use of
               multilevel modeling to estimate both aggregate- and
               individual-level parameters simultaneously. We use Monte Carlo
               experiments and three applied examples to explore the advantages

  abstract = "While traditionally considered for non-stationary and cointegrated
              data, DeBoef and Keele suggest applying a General Error Correction
              Model (GECM) to stationary data with or without cointegration. The
              GECM has since become extremely popular in political science but
              practitioners have confused essential points. For one, the model
              is treated as perfectly flexible when, in fact, the opposite is
              true. Time series of various orders of integration—stationary,
              non-stationary, explosive, near-and fractionally integrated—should
              not be analyzed together but researchers consistently make this
              mistake. That is, without equation balance the model is
              misspecified and hypothesis tests and long-run-multipliers are
              unreliable. Another problem is that the error correction term's
              sampling distribution moves dramatically depending upon the order
              of integra-tion, sample size, number of covariates, and the
              boundedness of Y t . This means that practitioners are likely to
              overstate evidence of error correction, especially when using a
              traditional t-test. We evaluate common GECM practices with six
              types of data, 746 simulations, and five paper replications."

              important methodological innovations. This same research is at
              risk of being devalued because of the increased evidence of the
              prevalence of data mining, publication bias, and other problematic
              research practices and norms. In order to combat these problematic
              norms, there is growing interest in transparency practices in the
              social sciences. At present, the bulk of this work is centered
              around randomized controlled trials. These experiments, however,
              constitute only a small fraction of all social science research.
              As a result, in order to improve research transparency in the

              plans. I then outline suggested contents for observational
              pre-analysis plans, and highlight areas where these plans should

               Most scholarship focuses on the proximate cause of electoral
               competition. This article proposes a different answer by
               constructing and analyzing an original data set drawn from the
               German parliament's own voluminous record of election disputes
               for every parliamentary election in the life of Imperial Germany
               (1871–1912) after its adoption of universal male suffrage in
               1871. The article analyzes the election of over 5,000
               parliamentary seats to identify where and why elections were
               disputed as a result of “election misconduct.” The empirical
               analysis demonstrates that electoral fraud's incidence is
               significantly related to a society's level of inequality in
               landholding, a major source of wealth, power, and prestige in
               this period. After weighing the importance of two different
               causal mechanisms, the article concludes that socioeconomic
               inequality, by making elections endogenous to preexisting social
               power, can be a major and underappreciated barrier to the
               long-term process of democratization even after the “choice” of

              adjustment of estimated treatment effects in randomized
              experiments, using Neyman's model for randomization inference.
              Contrary to conventional wisdom, he argued that adjustment can
              lead to worsened asymptotic precision, invalid measures of
              precision, and small-sample bias. This paper shows that in
              sufficiently large samples, those problems are either minor or
              easily fixed. OLS adjustment cannot hurt asymptotic precision when
              a full set of treatment-covariate interactions is included.
              Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with
              the Huber-White sandwich standard error estimator. Checks on the
              asymptotic approximations are illustrated with data from Angrist,

              Yet commonly used statistical methods for identifying causal
              mechanisms rely upon untestable assumptions and are often
              inappropriate even under those assumptions. Randomizing treatment
              and intermediate variables is also insufficient. Despite these

              abandon. We make three contributions to improve research on causal
              mechanisms. First, we present a minimum set of assumptions
              required under standard designs of experimental and observational
              studies and develop a general algorithm for estimating causal
              mediation effects. Second, we provide a method for assessing the
              sensitivity of conclusions to potential violations of a key
              assumption. Third, we offer alternative research designs for
              identifying causal mechanisms under weaker assumptions. The
              proposed approach is illustrated using media framing experiments
              and incumbency advantage studies. © 2011 American Political

              identification generates, among its empirical implications, stable
              partisanship among adults. The model further implies that
              susceptibility to partisan change declines with age. The
              significance of Achen's model for the study of party
              identification leads us to examine more closely its underlying
              assumptions and the empirical ramifications of this and other
              learning models. Method: This essay develops a more general
              learning model, based upon the Kalman filter, that encompasses the
              Achen model as a special case. Results: We show that the Achen
              assumption of a fixed party benefit level leads to implausible
              implications about how voters learn from the history of party
              performance. When party benefit levels are allowed to vary over

              attitudes, even among the older segments of the population, remain
              stable in the wake of new information about the parties. We
              conclude by discussing the empirical viability of our revised

               distribution of potential confounders changes continuously around
               the cutoff, the discontinuous jump in the probability of
               treatment assignment can be used to identify the treatment
               effect. Although a recent strand of the RD literature advocates
               interpreting this design as a local randomized experiment, the
               standard approach to estimation and inference is based solely on
               continuity assumptions that do not justify this interpretation.
               In this article, we provide precise conditions in a randomization
               inference context under which this interpretation is directly
               justified and develop exact finite-sample inference procedures

               available close enough to the threshold where local randomization
               is plausible, and hence standard large-sample procedures may be
               suspect. Our proposed methodology is intended as a complement and
               a robustness check to standard RD inference approaches. We

               party-level advantage in U.S. Senate elections, where the number

              measurement error associated with individual survey items. First,
              we show that averaging a large number of survey items on the same
              broadly defined issue area - for example, government involvement
              in the economy, or moral issues - eliminates a large amount of

              number of survey items increases and can approach that of party

              been reduced through the use of multiple measures, issue
              preferences have much greater explanatory power in models of
              presidential vote choice, again approaching that of party

              effects of drug policies and sentencing laws governing violent and
              drug crimes - are well known. Since die late 1980s, black
              involvement in violent crime has declined substantially, but
              racial disproportions have not. Blacks are six to seven times more
              likely than whites to be in prison. Nearly a third of young black
              men are under criminal justice system control. A third of black
              boys born in 2001 are predicted to spend some time in prison. The
              simplest explanation for these patterns is that drug and
              sentencing policies that contribute to disparities have not been
              significantly changed in decades. The question then is, why not?
              The answer is that the white majority does not empathize with poor
              black people who wind up in prison. That in turn is because recent
              punishment policies have replaced the urban ghetto, Jim Crow laws,

               acceptance. Scholars argue that recent U.S. demographic changes
               are replacing our historically binary race relations system with
               a more complicated system of racial stratification, in which
               Latinos, Asian Americans, Middle Easterners and Asian Indians
               enjoy a status different from both whites and blacks
               (Bonilla-Silva 2004; Gans 1999; Lee and Bean 2007). Such racial
               boundaries and hierarchies are reflected not only in the economic
               and structural realm, but also in the domain of intimacy (Blumer
               1958). However, limited research has explored the complexity of
               racial exclusion in multiethnic romantic settings. Using a sample
               of internet dating profiles, we examine racial exclusion by
               whites, blacks, Asians and Latinos within the realm of
               heterosexual romantic relationships. Our analyses shed light on
               the social distance that groups feel towards one another in the
               domain of intimacy, revealing how willing different groups are to
               cross racial boundaries, and which racial-gender groups are most
               included and excluded. Our approach contributes to the
               understanding of interracial relations in several ways. First,
               examining stated acceptance of other racial-ethnic groups as
               dates may overcome some of the limitations in using actual
               pairings or abstract attitudes to measure social distance between
               racial groups. Marriage and dating outcomes are influenced by
               both preferences and opportunities, but cannot distinguish
               between the two. On the other hand, surveys of attitudes and
               social distance scales are limited to hypothetical scenarios
               (Bogardus 1968; Yancey 2003). In contrast, our data provide a
               rare opportunity to examine people's stated preferences in a
               real-life situation. Second, the literature on interracial dating
               and racial boundaries generally focuses on white-minority
               relationships, ignoring We thank Golnaz Komaie, Rennie Lee and

               whites, and is the first to examine the extent to which whites
               and minorities are willing to include Asian Indians and Middle
               Easterners as possible dates. Third, we move beyond existing
               theories of racial-ethnic relations by considering how racial
               preferences differ by gender.",

               answer to that question complicated by race? These broad
               questions have danced at the edges of American community studies
               and politics for a century, from Sombart's (1976) first inkling
               that ethnic diversity might undermine proletarian solidarity,
               through the dramatic and violent backlashes during the arrival of
               black Americans to northern cities during the Great Migration,
               through the white flight exodus of the late midcentury, and now
               into our new era of even more ethnoracially kaleido-scopic
               metropolitan life. For more than a half century, social
               scientists have been trying to unravel the complicated
               relationships between social context, political outcomes, and
               public policy, and all the while those same factors have been
               changing America and one another faster than we can keep up.
               Questions asked and lessons learned in this area are more
               important than ever, as globalization, continued urbanization ,
               and social friction accelerate in the United States and around
               the world. It is not easy to make important original
               contributions in these debates, but Jessica Trounstine, Clayton
               Nall, and Ryan Enos have each done so with their new books. Each
               of these works is of the ``straight to the syllabus'' class, for
               the clarity of argument and the creativity with which they
               generate and test their theories about how places and politics
               are made. Individually, each poses well-reasoned theories to
               advance our knowledge of important social processes and tests
               these theories with analyses of deceptive felicity-deceptive
               because an incredible amount of research and labor lies behind
               their slim volumes. Collectively, they make invaluable
               contributions to explain how we got to where we are and what to
               expect now that we are here. Before digging into the specific
               contributions of each piece, we can situate this burst of
               scholarly energy as part of a spatial turn that spans academic
               disciplines. Driven in part by the increasing accessibility and
               intuitively illustrative power of geographic information
               technology, an ever-growing community of scholars is asking
               questions that begin with and can be at least partially answered
               with maps. Trounstine begins her tale with a compelling
               comparison of adjacent New Jersey towns, and her geographic lens
               adjusts its focus to show the expansion of how local institutions
               segregate groups across the American city. Nall cleverly uses
               highway maps overlaid onto more conventional (but still spatially
               located, at the center or the periphery) measures of population
               and voting behavior to analyze the surprising effects of policies
               that help us move through that space. Enos is most explicit about
               this approach, building his argument in part on a deep human
               propensity toward relying on ``maps in our heads'' to navigate
               the world, and he pays close attention to the dimensions of space
               in defining context. Each of these accounts relies not only on
               the kinds of data that can be rectangularized and shuffled (i.e.,
               with independent observations, although they do include these
               more conventional kinds of data) but also on the kinds of
               insights we can draw when we consider objects relationally and
               spatially, either in terms of their unique position relative to
               each other or in light of the other spatial characteristics they
               bear (distance from something else, density, clustering). The
               increasing frequency of this kind of political analysis is a
               salutary development.",

              Persuaders influence receivers' beliefs by proposing models
              (likelihood functions) that specify how to organize past data
              (e.g., on investment performance) to make predictions (e.g., about
              future returns). Receivers are assumed to find models more
              compelling when they better explain the data, fixing receivers'
              prior beliefs over states of the world. A key tradeoff facing
              persuaders is that models that better fit the data induce less
              movement in receivers' beliefs. Model persuasion sometimes makes
              the receiver worse off than he would be in the absence of
              persuasion. Even when the receiver is exposed to the true model,
              the wrong model often wins because it better fits the past. The
              receiver is most misled by persuasion when there is a lot of data
              that is open to interpretation and exhibits randomness, as this
              gives the persuader ``wiggle room'' to highlight false patterns.
              With multiple persuaders, competition pushes towards models that
              provide overly good fits, which tend to neutralize the data by
              leading receivers to view it as unsurprising. With multiple
              receivers, a persuader is more effective when he can send
              tailored, private messages than a menu of public messages. We
              illustrate with examples from finance, business, politics, and
              law.",

               mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced
               students from engineering and economics would also find the book
               useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an
               understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits,
               continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and
               convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is
               included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal
               introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract
               concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then
               rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for

               integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and
               Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary

               program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard
               requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of
               standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with
               Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence
               theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers
               including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications
               and then weak convergence of probability distributions,
               characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and
               the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with
               conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an
               introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III
               (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time
               Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC,
               continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian
               motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching
               processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an

              the 2012 French presidential election. While existing experiments
              randomized door-to-door visits at the individual level, the scale
              of this campaign (five million doors knocked) enabled
              randomization by precinct, the level at which vote shares are
              recorded administratively. Visits did not affect turnout, but
              increased Hollande's vote share in the first round and accounted
              for one-fourth of his victory margin in the second. Visits' impact
              persisted in later elections, suggesting a lasting persuasion
              effect. (JEL C93, D7, D83) Consumers and voters base their
              economic and political decisions on preferences and beliefs shaped
              by their direct observations, the communication they receive, and
              discussions with others. Interpersonal discussions contribute to
              the spread of information and peer effects in technology adoption
              (e.g., Foster and Rosenzweig 1995; Conley and Udry 2010),
              educational choices (e.g., Bobonis and Finan 2009), or financial
              decisions (e.g., Duflo and Saez 2003; Banerjee et al. 2013), and
              political discussions are commonly seen as the healthy expression
              of a functioning democracy. To the extent that democracy revolves
              around the deliberation and transformation of people's
              preferences, rather than the simple aggregation of their votes,
              discussion may actually be as important a condition of democracy
              as the electoral participation of all citizens (Habermas 1996;
              Elster 1998). The importance people attach to political
              discussions is illustrated by DellaVigna et al.'s (2017) result
              that many of us vote in order to later be able ``to tell others.''
              But discussions also affect future political behavior. In their
              pioneering study on the 1940 US presidential election, Lazarsfeld
              et al. (1944) find that most voters got their information about
              the candidates from family members, friends, and colleagues,
              rather than from the media (see also Gentzkow and Shapiro 2011).
              Nickerson (2008) and Bond et al. (2012) provide direct evidence of

              exposed to counter-attitudinal evidence or arguments, their
              pre-existing opinions and beliefs are reinforced, resulting in a
              phenomenon sometimes known as 'backlash'. This article formalizes
              the concept of backlash and specifies how it can be measured. It
              then presents the results from three survey experiments-two on
              Mechanical Turk and one on a nationally representative sample-that
              find no evidence of backlash, even under theoretically favorable
              conditions. While a casual reading of the literature on
              information processing suggests that backlash is rampant, these
              results indicate that it is much rarer than commonly supposed. If
              people of opposing views can each find support for those views in
              the same body of evidence, it is small wonder that social science
              research […] will frequently fuel rather than calm the fires of
              debate.-Lord et al. (1979) For several decades, research on public
              opinion and information processing has presented a challenge for
              believers in evidence-based decision making. Its prognosis for the
              body politic is dire: instead of prompting a reconsideration of
              long-held views, counter-attitudinal evidence may actually
              strengthen pre-existing beliefs, resulting in polarization. This
              prediction of backlash is associated with numerous theoretical
              perspectives and has led to an emerging consensus among scholars
              that attempts to persuade voters, challenge opponents or correct
              factual misperceptions can often result in the opposite of the
              intended effect. According to this consensus, people
              work-consciously or not-to protect their worldviews via a series
              of complementary belief-preserving mechanisms (Kunda 1990).
              Examples include the prior attitude effect, the tendency to
              perceive evidence and arguments that support one's views as
              stronger and more persuasive than those that challenge them;
              disconfirmation bias, in which people exert effort to
              counter-argue vigorously against evidence that is not congruent
              with their beliefs; and various forms of selective exposure and
              selective attention to congenial information, sometimes referred
              to as confirmation bias (Taber and Lodge 2006). The cumulative
              effect of these mechanisms is polarization. People exposed to the
              same information may respond by strengthening their pre-existing
              views. The canonical explication and demonstration of these

               States experienced an enormous rise in incarceration, a
               substantial portion of which was caused by high rates of return
               to prison among those previously incarcerated. This study shows
               that such returns are primarily a product of postprison community
               supervision rather than criminogenic effects of imprisonment, as
               many individuals sentenced to prison become trapped in the
               escalating surveillance and punishment of the criminal justice
               system. In other words, the rise in incarceration in the United
               States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries was in part a
               self-perpetuating process resulting from the workings of the
               criminal justice system itself. Abstract A substantial
               contributor to prison admissions is the return of individuals
               recently released from prison, which has come to be known as
               prison's ``revolving door.'' However, it is unclear whether being
               sentenced to prison itself has a causal effect on the probability
               of a subsequent return to prison or on criminal behavior. To
               examine the causal effect of being sentenced to prison on
               subsequent offending and reimprisonment, we leverage a natural
               experiment using the random assignment of judges with different
               propensities for sentencing offenders to prison. Drawing on data
               on all individuals sentenced for a felony in Michigan between
               2003 and 2006, we compare individuals sentenced to prison to
               those sentenced to probation, taking into account sentence
               lengths and stratifying our analysis by race. Results show that
               being sentenced to prison rather than probation increases the
               probability of imprisonment in the first 3 years after release
               from prison by 18 percentage points among nonwhites and 19
               percentage points among whites. Further results show that such
               effects are driven primarily by imprisonment for technical
               violations of community supervision rather than new felony
               convictions. This suggests that more stringent postprison parole
               supervision (relative to probation supervision) increases
               imprisonment through the detection and punishment of low-level
               offending or violation behavior. Such behavior would not
               otherwise result in imprisonment for someone who had not already
               been to prison or who was not on parole. These results
               demonstrate that the revolving door of prison is in part an
               effect of the nature of postprison supervision.",

              r ecen t dec a de s, American politics has been dominated, at
              least rhetorically, by a battle over the size of government. But
              that is not what the next few decades of our politics will be
              about. With the frontiers of the state roughly fixed, the issues
              that will define our major debates will concern the complexity of
              government, rather than its sheer scope. With that complexity has
              also come incoherence. Conservatives over the last few years have
              increasingly worried that America is, in Friedrich Hayek's ominous
              terms, on the road to serfdom. But this concern as-cribes vastly
              greater purpose and design to our approach to public policy than
              is truly warranted. If anything, we have arrived at a form of
              govern-ment with no ideological justification whatsoever. The
              complexity and incoherence of our government often make it
              difficult for us to understand just what that government is doing,
              and among the practices it most frequently hides from view is the
              grow-ing tendency of public policy to redistribute resources
              upward to the wealthy and the organized at the expense of the
              poorer and less orga-nized. As we increasingly notice the
              consequences of that regressive redistribution, we will inevitably
              also come to pay greater attention to the daunting and
              self-defeating complexity of public policy across mul-tiple,
              seemingly unrelated areas of American life, and so will need to
              start thinking differently about government. Understanding,
              describing, and addressing this problem of complex-ity and
              incoherence is the next great American political challenge. But
              you cannot come to terms with such a problem until you can
              prop-erly name it. While we can name the major questions that
              divide our Nat iona l Affa ir s · Fa l l 2013 98 politics —
              liberalism or conservatism, big government or small — we have no
              name for the dispute between complexity and simplicity in
              gov-ernment, which cuts across those more familiar ideological
              divisions. For lack of a better alternative, the problem of
              complexity might best be termed the challenge of `` kludgeocracy.
              '' A `` kludge '' is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as
              `` an ill-assorted collection of parts assembled to fulfill a
              particular purpose . . . a clumsy but temporarily effective
              solution to a particular fault or prob-lem. '' The term comes out
              of the world of computer programming, where a kludge is an
              inelegant patch put in place to solve an unexpected problem and
              designed to be backward-compatible with the rest of an existing
              system. When you add up enough kludges, you get a very
              com-plicated program that has no clear organizing principle, is
              exceedingly difficult to understand, and is subject to crashes.
              Any user of Microsoft Windows will immediately grasp the concept.
              `` Clumsy but temporarily effective '' also describes much of
              American public policy today. To see policy kludges in action, one
              need look no further than the mind-numbing complexity of the
              health-care system (which even Obamacare's champions must admit
              has only grown more complicated under the new law, even if in
              their view the system is now also more just), or our byzantine
              system of funding higher education, or our bewildering
              federal-state system of governing everything from wel-fare to
              education to environmental regulation. America has chosen to
              govern itself through more indirect and incoherent policy
              mechanisms than can be found in any comparable country. The
              effects of this approach to public policy are widespread and
              pro-found. But to understand how to treat our government's
              ailment, we first need to understand the symptoms, the character,
              and the causes of that ailment. t he costs of comple x i t y",

              economics lens to look at programs that serve poor and vulnerable
              people in the United States. Sponsored by the Office of Planning,
              Research and Evaluation of the Administration for Children and
              Families (ACF) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human
              Services, the BIAS project aims to learn how tools from behavioral
              economics can improve the well-being of individuals and families
              served by programs that ACF supports. Many human services programs
              require clients to make active decisions and follow a series of
              steps in order to reap a benefit--from deciding to apply, to
              completing forms, to arranging for child care. Program designers
              often assume that individuals will carefully consider options,
              make decisions that maximize their well-being, and diligently
              follow through. Behavioral economics, which combines insights from
              psychology and economics, may help explain why these assumptions
              are not always borne out. By describing work in three sites, this
              report illustrates how the BIAS project draws on the principles of
              behavioral economics to design solutions for ACF programs. In
              partnership with program administrators, the BIAS team uses a
              method called ``behavioral diagnosis and design'' to delve into
              problems that program administrators have identified, diagnose
              potential bottlenecks that may inhibit program performance, and
              identify areas where a relatively easy and low-cost, behaviorally
              informed change might improve outcomes. Working with the Texas
              Office of the Attorney General's Child Support Division, the BIAS
              team explored ways to increase the number of incarcerated
              noncustodial parents who apply for a modification of their child
              support order, with the goal of preventing further accrual of
              child support arrears. The project team also engaged with the
              Illinois Department of Human Services and one of its job search
              contractors to identify behavioral interventions that could help
              increase the rate of engagement in job search assistance among
              clients who receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
              Finally, work with the National Domestic Violence Hotline (NDVH)
              focused on reducing the number of callers who reach a hold message
              but hang up before talking to an NDVH staffer. Working with the

              include the following: (1) The behavioral diagnosis and design
              process provides a means of identifying and addressing key reasons
              that programs may not be performing to expectation. The process
              can uncover behavioral bottlenecks that are amenable to behavioral
              solutions. It may also identify structural issues, such as a need
              to hire more staff, which are often outside the scope of the BIAS
              project. (2) The diagnosis process encourages program designers to
              step back and examine multiple possible explanations for
              underperformance before embracing a particular theory or solution.
              This may improve the likelihood of success of any behavioral
              intervention. As the project moves forward, the BIAS team will
              continue to work with public officials to design and apply
              behavioral interventions in ACF program areas to generate new ways
              of tackling problems. Promising interventions will be tested using
              rigorous research designs, employing experimental methods to
              reliably determine the impact of an intervention. Future
              publications will report the impacts of these interventions.

  abstract = "Over the past quarter-century, private pension plans in the United
              States have trended toward a do-it-yourself approach in which
              covered workers bear more invest-ment risk and make more decisions
              themselves about their retirement savings. Some workers have
              thrived under this more individualized approach, amassing siz-able
              balances in 401(k) plans and similar plans that will assure them a
              comfortable and relatively secure retire-ment income. For others,
              however, the 401(k) revolution has fallen short of its potential.
              Work, family, and other more immediate competing demands often
              distract workers from the need to save and invest for the future.
              Those who do take the time to consider their choices find the
              decisions they face to be quite complex: Individual financial
              planning is seldom a simple task. For many workers, the result is
              poor decisionmaking at each stage of the retirement saving
              process, putting the level and security of their retirement income
              at risk. Even worse, in the face of those difficult choices, many
              people simply procrastinate and thereby avoid dealing with the
              issues altogether, dramatically raising the likelihood that they
              will save inadequate amounts for retirement. A disarmingly simple
              concept — what we call the automatic 401(k) — has the potential to
              cut through that Gordian knot and improve retirement security for
              mil-lions of workers via a set of common-sense reforms. In a
              nutshell, the automatic 401(k) consists of changing the default
              option at each phase of the 401(k) savings cycle to make sound
              saving and investment decisions the norm, even, and especially,
              when the worker never gets around to making a choice in the first
              place. Given the current structure of most 401(k) plans, workers
              do not participate unless they actively choose to. In contrast,
              under an automatic 401(k) they would participate unless they
              ac-tively choose not to — and similarly for each major decision
              thereafter. Contributions would be made, in-creased gradually over
              time, invested prudently, and preserved for retirement, all
              without putting the onus on workers to take the initiative for any
              of those steps. At the same time, however, workers would remain
              free to override the default options — to choose whether or not to
              save, and to control how their savings are invested — but those
              who fail to exercise the initiative would not be left behind. The
              steps involved in building an automatic 401(k) are not complicated
              and the benefits could be substantial; indeed, a growing body of
              empirical evidence suggests that the automatic 401(k) may be the
              most promising approach to bolstering retirement security for
              millions of American families. A number of economists have
              under-taken important research and contributed practical
              sug-gestions concerning the actual and potential uses of automatic
              enrollment and related default arrangements in 401(k) plans. 1
              Drawing on their contributions, this article describes the
              motivation for, the features of, and the potential benefits of the
              automatic 401(k).",

              ex-emplars. The theory claims that the two systems devel-oped to
              fulfill different functional roles and in turn have distinct
              evolutionary histories. The experiential system is the older of
              the two, operating in humans and nonhu-mans, and although crude,
              it processes information ef-fortlessly. The analytic system has a
              relatively short evo-lutionary history, is unique to humans, and
              was developed to operate in the medium of language. Early research
              on human judgment and decision making provided much evidence to
              suggest that there were com-peting modes of thought, one of which
              is intuitive and the other extensional, and that they led to
              entirely different types of responses (e.g., Hammond \& Summers,
              1972; Tversky \& Kahneman, 1983). Tversky and Kahneman (1974)
              claimed that intuitive type reasoning is informal and
              unstructured, and relies on heuristics that include such
              computations as similarity, representativeness (i.e., the
              assessment of the degree of correspondence between a sample and a
              population), and attributions of causality. Tversky and Kahneman
              shared Epstein's (1973, 1994) view that the information the system
              acts upon is content specific and affective, whereas extensional
              reasoning is controlled, slow, and deliberate and acts as a
              regulator monitoring intuitive responses that it can choose to
              en-dorse or override. Early dual-process theories led to a diverse
              set of as-sumptions about the nature and origins of the different
              types of reasoning identified. While the research programs
              developed from them center on different aspects of human behavior,
              the basic claims made are the same. The basis for proposing
              separate reasoning systems stems from the view that experiences
              are ordered very differently ac-cording to how they are used to
              reason about the world. Experiences are arranged such that they
              form initial in-tuitive understandings of the world that, when
              organized, can be used to control and manipulate certain mental
              ac-tivities. These two alternative uses result in differences in
              the way information is encoded, differences in behav-ior, and
              differences in expressible knowledge. This article focuses on
              three of the most influential dual-process theories currently
              pervading a wide range of work on thinking and reasoning. To
              begin, these theories will be described more thoroughly in terms
              of their characteriza-tion of the two processes, the functions
              they serve, and the type of information they encode. In the
              remainder of this section, connections are drawn across the
              theories and then discussed. Included in this section is the first
              of two ap-praisals of the dual-process account, to provide some
              eval-uation of the actual theoretical proposals made. At the end
              of this article comes the second evaluation, in which the theories
              are reviewed in relation to empirical findings.",

               Insights Team Behavioural insights is, in essence, quite a simple
               idea: if we adopt more sophisticated models of what it is that
               drives human behaviour—including judgements of risk and what
               people actually do—we might make better policy which is easier,
               more effective, and more cost effective too. It is important to
               note from the outset that we use behavioural insights (rather
               than behavioural economics) to refer to that range of literature
               about human behaviour from behavioural economics, social
               psychology, neuroscience and sociology. We prefer the term
               'behavioural insights' mainly because it is less doctrinal, and I
               know that there are many psychologists out there who feel that
               MANAGING UNDER AUSTERITy, DELIvERING UNDER PRESSURE 166
               'behavioural economics' has been appropriated by economists to
               the exclusion of psychologists. The UK Cabinet Office team feel
               that 'behavioural insights' is a broader, more encompassing term.
               The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government in
               Britain, particularly in 2010, brought this idea forward—that we
               could support and help people make better choices for themselves.
               It has been our brief for almost four years now, and we have had
               some fantastic results. Nuts and bolts changes There are two
               kinds of projects we do. One is 'nuts and bolts' changes, some of
               which have been quite long in the design and making. An example
               is a 2012 change to the defaults on employer-funded pensions
               (superannuation). We moved from an opt-in system to an opt-out
               system for employer pensions, leading to about 90 per cent of
               people staying in the system. It is a remarkable result. For
               decades, people have struggled to get the savings rate up of
               workers, and simply by changing the default we have achieved this
               remarkable effect. We are by no means the only ones in the world
               to do this, but it is still powerful and gratifying to see it
               working. There are other examples I can mention. We have run many
               randomised control trials to test the effects of small 'nudges'
               across a number of areas of domestic policy. One great success
               has been our initiative to change the letters issued by our tax
               office, Inland Revenue. Our tax authorities write millions of tax
               letters every year. We found that small changes in the
               wording—for example, telling people something that is true: 'most
               people pay their tax on time'—can be a very effective way of
               encouraging people to pay their tax. Even a small variation on
               that—saying 'most people in your area have paid their tax and you
               are one of the few that are yet to pay'—turns out to be a very
               effective way of increasing compliance and tax rates.
               Interestingly, it also reduces the number of complaints. The
               marginal cost of these changes is almost zero, and they are now
               bringing in hundreds of millions of pounds in forward payment on
               tax in the UK."

               METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group
               Specialized Register (14 April 2015); Cochrane Central Register
               of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library

               of ongoing and completed trials up to 14 April 2015. SELECTION
               CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
               quasi-RCTs comparing deworming drugs for soil-transmitted
               helminths with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years
               or less, reporting on weight, haemoglobin, and formal tests of
               intellectual development. We also sought data on school
               attendance, school performance, and mortality. We included trials
               that combined health education with deworming programmes. DATA
               COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS At least two review authors independently
               assessed the trials, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data.
               We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with
               95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we
               contacted trial authors. We used outcomes at time of longest
               follow-up. The evidence quality was assessed using GRADE. This
               edition of the Cochrane Review adds the DEVTA trial from India,
               and draws on an independent analytical replication of a trial
               from Kenya. MAIN RESULTS We identified 45 trials, including nine
               cluster-RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial
               evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the
               remaining 44 trials included a total of 67,672 participants.
               Eight trials were in children known to be infected, and 37 trials
               were carried out in endemic areas, including areas of high (15
               trials), moderate (12 trials), and low prevalence (10 trials).
               Treating children known to be infectedTreating children known to
               be infected with a single dose of deworming drugs (selected by
               screening, or living in areas where all children are infected)
               may increase weight gain over the next one to six months (627
               participants, five trials, low quality evidence). The effect size
               varied across trials from an additional 0.2 kg gain to 1.3 kg.
               There is currently insufficient evidence to know whether
               treatment has additional effects on haemoglobin (247
               participants, two trials, very low quality evidence); school
               attendance (0 trials); cognitive functioning (103 participants,
               two trials, very low quality evidence), or physical well-being
               (280 participants, three trials, very low quality evidence).
               Community deworming programmesTreating all children living in
               endemic areas with a dose of deworming drugs probably has little
               or no effect on average weight gain (MD 0.04 kg less, 95\% CI
               0.11 kg less to 0.04 kg more; trials 2719 participants, seven
               trials, moderate quality evidence), even in settings with high
               prevalence of infection (290 participants, two trials). A single
               dose also probably has no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.06
               g/dL, 95\% CI -0.05 lower to 0.17 higher; 1005 participants,
               three trials, moderate quality evidence), or average cognition
               (1361 participants, two trials, low quality evidence).Similiarly,
               regularly treating all children in endemic areas with deworming
               drugs, given every three to six months, may have little or no
               effect on average weight gain (MD 0.08 kg, 95\% CI 0.11 kg less
               to 0.27 kg more; 38,392 participants, 10 trials, low quality
               evidence). The effects were variable across trials; one trial
               from a low prevalence setting carried out in 1995 found an
               increase in weight, but nine trials carried out since then found
               no effect, including five from moderate and high prevalence

               probably has no effect on average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95\%

              creation in 2010 was to spread the understanding of behavioural
              approaches across the policy community. Alongside the policy work
              and trials conducted by the Team over the last three years, we
              have conducted many seminars, workshops and talks with policy
              makers, academics and practitioners. From these many sessions,
              together with our trials and policy work, has emerged a simple,
              pragmatic framework to help think about behaviour change. In the
              early years, we often used the MINDSPACE framework, and indeed
              some of the team were centrally involved in developing it.1 We
              still use this framework. But we found in seminars that its nine
              elements were hard for busy policy makers to keep in mind (itself
              reflecting ‘cognitive chunking’). At the same time, we found in
              our day-to-day trials and policy work that some of the most
              reliable effects came from changes that weren’t easily captured by
              MINDSPACE, or indeed by much of the academic literature. For
              example, we have often found that simplifying messages, or
              removing even the tiniest amount of ‘friction’ in a process, can
              have a large impact. For these reasons, we wanted to develop a
              shorter, simple mnemonic — the EAST framework. The EAST framework
              was developed by the Behavioural Insights Team from early 2012.
              After initial testing in seminars given by members of the team
              with UK Civil Servants, the first public ‘outing’ of EAST in its
              final form was in a short series of lectures I gave in Harvard and
              Washington later that year. Since then, we have refined and
              developed some of the core concepts and ideas, based on new
              findings and feedback from those we have tested EAST with. I would
              stress that, like most of what BIT does, it is very much the work
              of the team, and many have contributed to it – not least our
              friend and colleague Richard Thaler whose mantra is to ‘make it
              easy’. We hope you find this guide helpful. Getting familiar with
              the EAST framework won’t turn you into the world’s leading expert
              on behavioural insight. There are more complex frameworks and
              typologies, and many subtle and fascinating effects that EAST does
              not cover. But if even a small percentage of policies and
              practices are adapted as a result, EAST should lead to services
              that are easier and more pleasant for citizens to use, and more
              effective and cheaper too.",

              policing O ver the last several years, our nation has been rocked
              by an onslaught of incidents captured on video involving police
              officers' use of force with black suspects. The images from these
              cases are disturbing, both exposing and igniting police– community
              conflict all over the country: in New York, Missouri, Ohio, South
              Carolina, Maryland, Illinois, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and
              North Carolina. These images have renewed conversations about
              modern-day race relations and have led many to question how far we
              have come (1). In an effort to increase accountability and
              transparency, law enforcement agen-cies are adopting body-worn
              cameras at an extremely rapid pace (2, 3). Despite the rapid
              proliferation of body-worn cameras, no law enforcement agency has
              systematically analyzed the massive amounts of footage these
              cameras produce. Instead, the public and agencies alike tend to
              focus on the fraction of videos involv-ing high-profile incidents,
              using footage as evidence of innocence or guilt in individual
              encounters. Left unexamined are the common, everyday interactions
              between the police and the communities they serve. By best
              esti-mates, more than one quarter of the public (ages 16 y and
              over) comes into contact with the police during the course of a
              year, most frequently as the result of a police-initiated traffic
              stop (4, 5). Here, we examine body-worn camera footage of routine
              traf-fic stops in the large, racially diverse city of Oakland, CA.
              Routine traffic stops are not only common, they are
              conse-quential, each an opportunity to build or erode public trust
              in the police. Being treated with respect builds trust in the
              fairness of an officer's behavior, whereas rude or disrespectful
              treatment can erode trust (6, 7). Moreover, a person's experiences
              of respect or disrespect in personal interactions with police
              officers play a cen-tral role in their judgments of how
              procedurally fair the police are as an institution, as well as
              their willingness to support or cooperate with the police (8, 9).
              Blacks report more negative experiences in their interactions with
              the police than other groups (10). Across numerous studies, for
              example, blacks report being treated less fairly and respect-fully
              in their contacts with the police than whites (6, 11). Indeed,
              some have argued that racial disparities in perceived treatment
              during routine encounters help fuel the mistrust of police in the
              controversial officer-involved shootings that have received such
              great attention. However, do officers treat white commu-nity
              members with a greater degree of respect than they afford to
              blacks? We address this question by analyzing officers' language
              during vehicle stops of white and black community members.
              Although many factors may shape these interactions, an officer's
              words are undoubtedly critical: Through them, the officer can
              communicate respect and understanding of a citizen's perspec-tive,
              or contempt and disregard for their voice. Furthermore, the
              language of those in positions of institutional power (police
              officers, judges, work superiors) has greater influence over the
              course of the interaction than the language used by those with
              less power (12–16). Measuring officer language thus provides a
              quantitative lens on one key aspect of the quality or tone of
              police–community interactions, and offers new opportunities for
              advancing police training. Previous research on police–community
              interactions has relied on citizens' recollection of past
              interactions (10) or researcher observation of officer behavior
              (17–20) to assess procedural fair-ness. Although these methods are
              invaluable, they offer an indi-rect view of officer behavior and
              are limited to a small number of interactions. Furthermore, the
              very presence of researchers may influence the police behavior
              those researchers seek to measure (21)."

              can be exploited as a natural experiment and review several
              assumptions under which geographic natural experiments yield valid
              causal estimates. In particular, we focus on cases where a
              geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated
              and control areas. The different identification assumptions we
              consider suggest testable implications, which we use to establish
              their plausibility. Our methods are illustrated with an original
              study of whether ballot initiatives increase turnout in Wisconsin
              and Ohio, which illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of causal
              inferences based on geographic natural experiments. P olitical
              scientists have long used statistical techniques to infer causal
              relationships. Many advocate the use of experiments as the primary
              means of drawing causal inferences with statistics (Green and
              Gerber 2002). Given that experiments are often unfeasible, others
              advocate relying on natural experiments or quasi-experiments as
              much as possible (Sekhon 2009). Although natural experiments are
              considered by many to be the best alternative to randomized
              experimentation, they are not without complications. This stems
              from the fact that, in a natural experiment, assignment to
              treatment occurs in some haphazard manner. Although such haphazard
              treatment assignment is typically preferable to contexts where
              units entirely self-select into their treatment status, it is very
              different from the assignment in experiments where randomization
              is a known fact. As such, natural experiments generally entail
              compli-cations that are absent when randomization is known to hold
              (Sekhon and Titiunik 2012). Although natural experiments come in a
              myriad of forms, one popular type is based on geographic variation
              of the treatment of interest, where units in a treated area are
              compared with units in a control area. In this kind of natural
              experiment, certain features of geography allow researchers to
              plausibly claim that treatment assignment is haphazard or as-if
              random. Natural experiments based on geography have been used to
              draw causal inferences about nation building, governance, and
              ethnic relations in Africa (Asiwaju",

               science. To answer, we discuss data science from three
               perspectives: statistical, computational, and human. Although
               each of the three is a critical component of data science, we
               argue that the effective combination of all three components is
               the essence of what data science is about. data science |
               statistics | machine learning The term `` data science '' has
               attracted a lot of attention. Much of this attention is in
               business (1), in government (2), and in the academic areas of
               statistics (3, 4) and computer science (5, 6). Here, we discuss
               data science from the perspective of scientific research. What is
               data science? Why might scientists care about it? Our perspective
               is that data science is the child of statistics and computer
               science. While it has inherited some of their methods and
               thinking, it also seeks to blend them, refocus them, and develop
               them to address the context and needs of modern scientific data
               analysis. This perspective is not new. Over 50 years ago, Tukey
               (7) defined `` data analysis '' as a broad endeavor, much broader
               than traditional math-ematical statistics. In a sense, today's
               data science, although set against a modern backdrop, is cast
               from Tukey's original mold. In modern research, scientists from
               diverse disci-plines are confronting abundant datasets and are
               confident that there is value in the data for advancing their
               scientific goals. We give three examples at genomic, social, and
               galactic scales. First, modern sequencing technology has enabled
               high-resolution genetic sequencing at massive scale, and
               geneticists have connected the genetic data to large databases of
               individuals' behaviors and diseases. These data can potentially
               aid researchers in studying the human ge-nome, helping them
               understand how it evolves, and how it governs observed traits.
               Second, social scien-tists now have the opportunity to study
               large archives of digitized texts, often with rich information
               about human behavior and interactions. These data could help them
               more effectively navigate and understand the contours of society,
               finding relevant sources to their work and identifying hard to
               spot patterns of language that suggest new interpretations and
               theo-ries. Third, modern telescopes create digital sky sur-veys
               that have transformed observational astronomy, generating
               hundreds of terabytes of raw image data about billions of sky
               objects. A catalog of these ob-jects, if available, would give
               astronomers an unprec-edented window into the structure of the
               cosmos. These examples paint a picture of what might be possible
               in the modern sciences. However, an issue that pervades many, if
               not all, scientific disciplines is that scientists cannot yet
               fully take advantage of their new data. Connecting genes and
               traits at large scale is a problem that is beyond the limits of
               classical genome analysis, both computationally and
               statisti-cally. Building tools for navigating large collections

               randomization undermines the success of the treatment.
               Choice-based experimental designs allow a subset of the
               participants to choose their treatments. We discuss here causal
               inferences for hybrid experimental designs in which some
               participants are randomly allocated to treatments and others
               receive their treatment preference. This work was motivated by
               the Women Take Pride (WTP) study, a doubly randomized preference
               trial (DRPT) that assessed behavioral interventions for women
               with heart disease. We propose a model for estimating the causal
               effects in the subpopulations defined by treatment preferences,
               and thus preference effects. We describe an EM algorithm for
               computing maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters.
               We illustrate the method by analyzing sickness impact profile
               (SIP) scores and treatment adherence in the WTP data. Our results
               show some evidence that SIP scores were improved when women
               received their preferred treatment and strong preference effects

               treatment were more likely to adhere to the program. We also
               provide a framework for assessing the DRPT and other hybrid trial

               to inform the public, raising knowledge levels and reducing
               political knowledge gaps between citizens. But media are also
               seen as a force for segmentation, disengagement, and widening
               differences between citizens. If media have no effect on
               political knowledge, gaps between the engaged and disengaged
               persist regardless of who is exposed to news because no one
               learns. But gaps can also persist even if everyone learns from
               the news, particularly if learning effects are heterogeneous
               across those inclined and disinclined to seek out news and/or
               across environments that consist of different media alternatives.
               Yet past research on political communication has not sufficiently
               linked media choice to debates about possibly heterogeneous
               effects of media exposure on political knowledge levels. The
               present study contributes a novel and large-scale choice-based
               experiment on knowledge of the ongoing crisis in Syria that finds
               media effects are relatively homogeneous across those with
               different media preferences and across different media
               environments. This suggests that under most conditions ? even
               when everyone learns from the news ? knowledge gaps between the
               politically engaged and disengaged are widened or at least
               sustained after incidental exposure to politics. While closing
               such gaps may be impossible, the results have important
               implications for understanding how citizens learn about politics
               and how to study learning from self-selected media experiences.",

              Leveraging quasi-random geographic variation in media markets for

               specifically in the political acceptance of new issuesby news

               some extent for any group wishing to alter status quo

               that marriage equality had on changing American politics was much

               effects. 3) A new set of tools for understanding global model
               structure based on combining many local explanations of each
               prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine
               learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local
               explanations allows us to represent global structure while
               retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools

               attributed to its vagueness. Nowhere is this more true than in
               the empirical applications of intersectionality. When enacted
               empirically, intersectionality theory is usually conceptualized
               as a theory that fits four standards of empirical social
               research: (1) It explains a phenomenon. (2) It is grounded in a
               substantive literature. (3) It is falsifiable. (4) It is
               methodologically agnostic. Is this, however, the most appropriate
               way to empirically operationalize the legal theory of
               intersectionality? This chapter examines two contrasting

               of the economic hierarchy. Relative to men (across racial groups)
               and White women, Black and Latina women often have less-desirable
               jobs, lower earnings, and higher poverty rates. In this essay, we
               draw attention to the role of the state in structuring such
               inequality. Specifically, we examine how public policy is related
               to racial inequities in economic positions among women. Applying
               an intersectional lens to the contemporary landscape of economic
               inequality, we probe the associations between public policies and
               economic outcomes. We find that policies have unequal
               consequences across subgroups of women, providing prima facie
               evidence that state-level decisions about how and where to invest
               resources have differential implications based on women's race
               and ethnicity. We encourage scholars to use aspects of our
               approach as springboards for better specifying and identifying
               the processes that account for heterogeneous policy effects

              ethnocentrism - as the dominant group-based driver of preference

              consistent though smaller contributions in previous models. We

              data collected at a moment of severe economic upheaval, the days
              immediately prior to the 2008 presidential election. We expected

               race-conscious policies such as affirmative action. One
               explanation for this is that a new racial belief system—referred
               to as symbolic racism or racial resentment—has replaced
               “old-fashioned racism.” Another is that nonracial values such as
               ideology and a preference for small government now drive policy
               opinions. Our theory suggests that whereas disgust once
               accompanied ideas about “biologically inferior” groups, anger has
               become fused to conservative ideas about race in the contemporary
               period. As a result, anger now serves as the primary emotional
               trigger of whites’ negative racial attitudes. We experimentally
               induce disgust, anger, or fear using an apolitical task and find
               anger is uniquely powerful at boosting opposition to racially
               redistributive policies among white racial conservatives.
               Nonracial attitudes such as ideology and small government

               inaccurate statements from the news. Moving beyond partisanship,
               we theorize that ideological and ethnoracial identities also
               shape individuals' interpretations of the news. We argue that
               people have incentives to interpret information they encounter in
               ways that favor their ideological and ethnoracial ingroups and
               that these incentives are particularly strong when ideological
               and ethnoracial identities align. Using a survey that asks
               respondents to classify statements from news stories as facts or
               opinions, we find support for these hypotheses. Liberals and
               conservatives, and white, Black, and Hispanic respondents, more

              evolution of the abortion issue. Previous research indicates that
              party elites—specifically members of Congress—and partisans in the
              mass public have become more differentiated in their abortion
              attitudes during the last several decades with Democrats becoming
              more pro-choice and Republicans becoming increasingly pro-life.
              The missing piece of the picture is the behavior of party
              activists. Accordingly, this research examines the changes in the
              abortion attitudes of two groups of party activists during the
              last three decades: campaign activists and national convention
              delegates. From 1972 to 1980 there were no significant differences
              in the abortion attitudes of Republican and Democratic campaign
              activists, and the mean positions of the two parties' national
              convention delegates did not differ greatly. However, since 1984
              there has been a growing differentiation in the abortion positions
              of both groups of party activists. Now Democratic activists are
              consistently pro-choice while Republican activists are equally
              pro-life. This evidence indicates that the differentiation on the
              abortion issue that has only recently emerged among partisans in
              the mass public was predated by an earlier and much more dramatic
              polarization that had already developed among party activists and
              elites, thus supporting a model of issue evolution introduced by
              Carmines and Stimson in their study of racial issues. We also find
              that citizens' abortion attitudes have become increasingly
              correlated with party voting not just in presidential elections
              but also in House, Senate, and gubernatorial contests during this
              period as well as being more closely related to political
              ideology. All of this evidence points to the growing extent to
              which abortion has become a partisan issue in American politics
              and the key role that party activists have played in this process.",

              levels of support for abortion. This analysis examines how the
              determinants of abortion attitudes have changed between 1977 and
              1996, using data from the General Social Surveys. While in early
              time periods, whites were more approving of abortion than blacks,
              that pattern had reversed by the late 1980s. After controlling for
              other factors, older people are more accepting of abortion
              throughout the two decades, while gender is generally unrelated to
              abortion views. Catholic religion weakens slightly as a predictor
              of abortion attitudes, while religious fundamentalism and
              political liberalism increase in explanatory power. The
              associations between attitudinal correlates and abortion approval
              also change over this time period. Religiosity becomes a less
              powerful predictor of abortion attitudes, while respondents'
              attitude toward sexual freedom and belief in the sanctity of human
              life increase in their predictive power. Support for gender
              inequality remains a weak but stable predictor of abortion
              attitudes. This pattern of results suggests that the public is
              influenced more by the pro-life framework of viewing abortion than

               changes producing mass-level responses. Simple time series

              Grey's Anatomy on US-based viewers. METHOD: We conducted an online
              survey of likely Grey's Anatomy viewers prior to the episode's
              airing, assessing abortion ideology, knowledge, and support. After
              airing, we resurveyed respondents (including both those who had
              and had not viewed the target episode). We tested three
              hypotheses: episode exposure would (1) improve abortion knowledge
              and (2) increase support for medication abortion and decrease
              support for self-induced abortion, and (3) the effects on
              knowledge and supportive intention would be moderated by state
              support for abortion. We used independent samples t tests to
              examine hypotheses 1 and 2 and PROCESS macro to test the moderated
              effects (hypothesis 3). RESULTS: The results of the
              pretest/posttest analysis indicated that exposure to the episode
              significantly improved medication abortion knowledge. Increases in
              medication abortion knowledge were tied to explicit educational
              dialogue and did not translate into an increase in general
              abortion knowledge or social supportiveness. Notably,

              influence of exposure for respondents in states with policies
              favorable to abortion access. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest
              that entertainment television can contribute to meaningful
              increases in viewers' knowledge about abortion, but that the
              potential for impact of entertainment-education is closely linked
              to episode content and moderated by state-level abortion policy.",

               through three content analysis studies. The main finding
               presented in the paper is that the modal tweet generated between
               December 1, 2015 and October 31, 2016 was an emotional
               response—an expression of sadness, outrage, or despair—to police
               brutality and the killings of African Americans. The second key
               finding is that BLM organizations generated more tweets that
               framed the movement as a struggle for individual rights than ones
               that utilized frames about gender, racial, and LGBTQ identities.
               Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists urge their followers
               to pursue disruptive repertoires of contention less frequently
               than they encourage other political behaviors. These findings
               suggest that the BLM movement is intelligible through both the

               and transgender people. In these experiments, 230 canvassers
               conversed with 6,869 voters across 7 US locations. In Experiment
               1, face-to-face conversations deploying arguments alone had no

               attitudes, but otherwise identical conversations also including
               the non-judgmental exchange of narratives durably reduced
               exclusionary attitudes for at least four months (d = 0.08).

               findings and support the scalability of this strategy (ds = 0.08,

               experiments found that interpersonal conversations employing
               multiple narrative strategies can durably reduce exclusionary
               attitudes. We theoretically distinguish between three of these
               narrative strategies: narratives which promote analogic
               perspective taking, vicarious perspective-giving, and
               perspective-getting. Previous research has assigned these
               strategies together in a compound treatment, leaving open
               important theoretical and practical questions about each's
               effectiveness. We present results from three field studies and a
               survey experiment that individually manipulate their presence.
               Across the field studies, we find omitting prompts to engage in
               analogic perspective-taking and vicarious perspective-giving does
               not diminish effects; conversations employing only
               perspective-getting narratives durably reduce exclusionary
               attitudes. Results from within-subject analyses and a survey
               experiment similarly show that perspective-getting consistently
               reduces exclusionary attitudes and activates multiple mechanisms.
               These results refine theoretical understandings of prejudice
               reduction and support facilitating perspective-getting in
               conversations intended to reduce exclusionary attitudes.",

               thinking about public debate in democratic theory ? deliberative

               narrative is a crucial device by which people talk and think
               about complex and contested issues. It argues that deliberative
               democrats must come to terms with narrative because its pervasive
               influence can affect deliberative systems in important ways. The

              Americans are more likely to share their opinions with friends and
              family rather than co-workers and they are more likely to share
              their opinions on more salient topics. More importantly, they
              withhold their political attitudes specifically from those with
              whom they disagree in an attempt to avoid conflict. This produces
              the experience of highly homogeneous social contexts, in which
              only liberal or conservative views are voiced, while dissent
              remains silent, and oftentimes goes unacknowledged. This
              experience is not the result of homogeneous social contexts but
              the appearance of them. Paradoxically, the mechanism of selective
              disclosure, whose goal is to prevent conflict at the micro-level,
              might lead to the perception of greater division in the larger
              society.",

               explanation? and What is narrative explanation? In answering
               these questions, we develop a framework of narrative elements and
               characteristics of narrative explanations. Two possible examples
               of narrative explanation are presented and examined in light of
               the framework. This examination brings to light various

               the larger issue of the use of examples like them in science

               mechanisms that participate in prose comprehension are far from
               obvious. Even simple stories involve com plexities that have
               stymied many cognitive scientists. Why is prose comprehen sion so
               difficult to study? Perhaps because comprehension is guided by so
               many domains of knowledge. Perhaps because some critical
               mysteries of prose comprehension reside between the lines-in the
               mind of the comprehender. Ten years ago very few psychologists
               were willing to dig beyond the surface of explicit code in their
               studies of discourse processing. Tacit knowledge, world
               knowledge, inferences, and expectations were slippery notions

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In recent years, in an attempt to counter stigma and
              increase empathy, public education campaigns have encouraged
              people to share their personal abortion stories. This exploratory
              study sought to document negative and positive experiences of
              those who have shared their abortion stories publicly. STUDY
              DESIGN: We conducted an anonymous online survey of people who have
              shared their abortion story publicly (N = 88), recruited via
              partners affiliated with two abortion story-sharing campaigns. The
              survey asked about the context in which respondents shared their
              abortion story, any negative and positive experiences online and
              in ``real life'' as a result of story sharing, and any problems or
              benefits resulting from these experiences. We analyzed survey data
              using descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses and categorizing
              responses to open-ended questions. RESULTS: Sixty percent of
              respondents reported experiencing harassment and other negative
              incidents after sharing their story publicly. These experiences
              contributed to emotional stress, problems with loved ones and
              difficulties at work and/or school. These harms were reported even
              by many respondents who used only a first name or alias when
              sharing their story. Despite this, positive experiences as a
              result of story sharing were reported by four out of five
              respondents and motivated many to continue sharing their story.
              CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study indicates that many people who
              share their abortion story publicly find it to be an empowering,
              rewarding experience. Yet they also experience harassment and
              threats at high rates. Future research should explore both
              positive and negative experiences in more depth. IMPLICATIONS:
              Sharing one's personal abortion story as part of a public
              education campaign can be a positive, empowering experience.
              Nevertheless, policymakers, journalists and reproductive health
              advocates should recognize the potential harms experienced by
              people who share their abortion story publicly and consider
              measures to support these individuals.",

              inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to explain away the
              observed effect estimate or reduce it to a particular level. Our
              approach is easy to implement and involves only two sensitivity
              parameters. Surprisingly, our bounding factor, which makes no
              simplifying assumptions, is no more conservative than a number of
              previous sensitivity analysis techniques that do make assumptions.
              Our new bounding factor implies not only the traditional Cornfield
              conditions that both the relative risk of the exposure on the
              confounder and that of the confounder on the outcome must satisfy
              but also a high threshold that the maximum of these relative risks
              must satisfy. Furthermore, this new bounding factor can be viewed
              as a measure of the strength of confounding between the exposure
              and the outcome induced by a confounder.",

               loans made to minority applicants are observed to be repaid more
               often than loans made to whites, it suggests that only
               exceptionally qualified minorities are granted loans, indicating

               risk distributions. Applying our test to a dataset of 4.5 million

              observational studies that are potentially subject to confounding.
              The E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, on
              the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to
              have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away

               sensitivity parameters and can be easily computed by using only
               standard regression results. In particular, we introduce two
               novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting. The
               robustness value describes the minimum strength of association
               that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the
               treatment and with the outcome, to change the research

               shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual

               to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools

               department.Design/methodology/approach– Data from a survey of
               Baltimore officers, designed to examine the relationship between
               police stress and domestic violence in police families were used.
               Using multivariate regression analysis, the authors focus on the
               officers' stated intentions to look for alternative employment,
               with proxies for social and workplace factors.Findings– Higher
               levels of cooperation (trust), interactional justice and
               work‐life‐balance reduce police officers' intentions to quit.
               While high levels of physical and psychological strain and trauma
               are not correlated with intentions to quit.Research
               limitations/implications– A discernible limitation of this study
               is the age of the data analyzed and that many changes have
               occurred in recent times (policing and social). It would be of
               great interest to repeat this study to gauge the true
               effect.Practical implications– There are policy implications for
               retention and recruitment: it may possible to decrease the ethnic
               and gender gaps, through identifying officers at risk and
               creating programs to hold existing minorities, recruit more,

               department.Originality/value– This study examines the impact of
               workplace factors on quitting intention for police officers. It
               is demonstrated that social capital, fairness and work‐life
               balance are moderators for quitting, adding to the literature on
               worker retention, as little research has been done using

               are often tied to evidence of partisan bias in factual

               responding suggests that many apparent instances of such bias
               result from respondents insincerely reporting politically
               congenial views in order to gain expressive psychological
               benefits. Importantly, these findings have been interpreted as
               “good news for democracy” because partisans who knowingly report
               incorrect beliefs in surveys can act on their correct beliefs in
               the real world. We synthesize evidence and commentary on this
               matter, drawing two conclusions: (1) evidence for insincere
               expressive responding on divisive political matters is limited
               and ambiguous and (2) when experimental manipulations in surveys
               reduce reports of politically congenial factual beliefs, this is
               often because such reported beliefs serve as flexible and
               interchangeable ways of justifying the largely stable allegiances
               that guide political behavior. The expressive value of acting on
               political commitments should be viewed as a central feature of
               the American political context rather than a methodological
               artifact of surveys."

               is distinct from a more general sympathy, as it does not shape

               attitude; as evidence of this, I find that sympathy is activated
               when a policy draws attention to its black beneficiaries. In
               probing this effect, I find that even exposure to negative
               stereotypes of blacks does not extinguish the influence of
               sympathy. The consistent results across multiple national studies

              little is known about how to address the dismal rates of youth

              each year to participate in the Teach For America (TFA) program-a
              prominent voluntary national service organization in the United

              Investigators often use linear multivariate regression to analyze
              randomized experiments instead of simply reporting the difference
              of means between treatment and control groups. Their aim is to
              reduce the variance of the estimated treatment effect by adjusting
              for covariates. If there are a large number of covariates relative
              to the number of observations, regression may perform poorly
              because of overfitting. In such cases, the least absolute
              shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) may be helpful. We study
              the resulting Lasso-based treatment effect estimator under the

              theoretical conditions that guarantee that the estimator is more

              difference-of-means estimator. Simulation and data examples show
              that Lasso-based adjustment can be advantageous even when the
              number of covariates is less than the number of observations.
              Specifically, a variant using Lasso for selection and ordinary
              least squares (OLS) for estimation performs particularly well, and

               coalitions that were driven by people's racial and ethnic
               identities. The campaign then reinforced and exacerbated those
               cleavages as it focused on issues related to race, immigration,
               and religion. The result was an epic battle not just for the

              behavior — regressions of vote choice on voter characteristics —
              is useful for evaluating correlates and determinants of vote
              choice, but is incapable of assessing how many votes a group

              size and its turnout rate. We introduce a set of tools for
              estimating how many votes a bloc gives to a candidate, how voting
              bloc patterns differ from prior elections, and how support changes
              under counterfactuals. We apply these tools to study U.S.
              presidential elections, demonstrating that there is little

              include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid substitutions
              and composition of ecological communities. The macroscopic
              patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape
              that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative
              model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased or
              random stochastic fluctuations: random connections of network
              nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness; species
              that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These neutral
              generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this
              paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can
              understand why these neutral generative models are so successful.
              I show where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson
              pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern and many others. Each
              classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral
              generative model. The neutral patterns share a special
              characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow
              from simple constraints on information. For example, any
              aggregation of processes that preserves information only about the
              mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern; any
              aggregation that preserves information only about the mean

              preserves information only about the geometric mean attracts to
              the power law pattern. I present a simple and consistent
              informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on
              the method of maximum entropy. This framework shows that each
              neutral generative model is a special case that helps to discover
              a particular set of informational constraints; those informational
              constraints define a much wider domain of non-neutral generative

                   scale the senators of the 116th United States Congress along
                   the liberal-conservative spectrum by prompting ChatGPT to
                   select the more liberal (or conservative) senator in pairwise

                 differences in underlying individual characteristics, or by
                 biased decision makers. Becker (1957, 1993) proposed an outcome
                 test of bias based on differences in post-decision outcomes
                 across groups, inspiring a large and growing empirical

               sidelines has not been adequately explored and remains not well
               understood. In 2019, protests against an extradition bill
               amendment led to unprecedented mass demonstrations, riots, and
               electoral turnout in Hong Kong. Young people were among the
               largest and most engaged participant groups during the movement.
               Yet even though protest action became a part of daily life on
               campuses, some students who sympathized with the movement did not
               become active supporters. This analysis examined reasons for
               non-participation using survey and interview data from
               undergraduate students. In particular, this study analyzed
               possible causes for the non-conversion of sympathizers into
               participants and the erosion of protest participants. Differences
               among students were explored based on their origin. The findings

               ineffective mobilization of otherwise highly sympathetic

              likely to say they enjoy a lively political argument, while women
              are more conflict avoidant. These differences in people’s
              orientations toward conflict are thought to contribute to gender
              gaps in political interest and engagement. I explore this using
              survey responses to a module of the 2016 Cooperative Congressional
              Election Study. I find that people’s positive reactions to
              conflict better explain the decision to engage in politics than
              negative reactions to disagreements. While women report higher
              levels of conflict avoidance than men, gender gaps in political
              engagement cannot be explained by women’s greater aversion to
              conflict. Instead, gender gaps are better understood as a product

               We show that controlling for differential time trends in birth
               rates by a market's pretreatment racial/ethnic composition or

              find that bias due to selection on unobservables, commonly called
              selection bias in econometrics, is empirically less important than
              other components, although it is still a sizeable fraction of the

               Many applied researchers use the 2FE estimator to adjust for
               unobserved unit-specific and time-specific confounders at the

              applying a quasi-experimental research design. In 1999, the
              Italian central government introduced fiscal rules aimed at
              imposing fiscal discipline on municipal governments, and in 2001
              the rules were relaxed for municipalities below 5,000 inhabitants.
              This institutional change allows us to implement a
              “difference-indiscontinuities” design by combining the
              before/after with the discontinuous policy variation. Our
              estimates show that relaxing fiscal rules triggers a substantial
              deficit bias, captured by a shift from a balanced budget to a
              deficit that amounts to 2 percent of the total budget. The deficit
              comes primarily from reduced revenues as unconstrained
              municipalities have lower real estate and income tax rates.
              Finally, we investigate the heterogeneity in policy responses
              across municipalities to provide new evidence about the costs and
              benefits of restricting fiscal policy. The impact is larger if the

               databases and other sources for primary studies that used the
               Moral Foundations Questionnaire and a typical measure of
               political orientation, a political self-placement item. We used a

               two authors and ran both study-level and individual-level
               analyses. With 89 samples, 605 effect sizes, and 33,804
               independent participants, in addition to 192,870 participants
               from the widely used YourMorals.org website, the basic
               differences about conservatives and liberals are supported. Yet,
               heterogeneity is moderate, and the results may be less
               generalizable across samples and political cultures than
               previously thought. The effect sizes obtained from the
               YourMorals.org data appear inflated compared with independent
               samples, which is partly related to political interest and may be
               because of self-selection. The association of moral foundations
               to political orientation varies culturally (between regions and
               countries) and subculturally (between White and Black respondents
               and in response to political interest). The associations also
               differ depending on the choice of the social or economic
               dimension and its labeling, supporting both the bidimensional
               model of political orientation and the findings that the
               dimensions are often strongly correlated. Our findings have

               Harry Truman's decision to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and
               Nagasaki has declined significantly since 1945. Many scholars and
               political figures argue that this decline constitutes compelling
               evidence of the emergence of a “nuclear taboo” or that the
               principle of noncombatant immunity has become a deeply held norm.
               An original survey experiment, recreating the situation that the
               United States faced in 1945 using a hypothetical U.S. war with
               Iran today, provides little support for the nuclear taboo thesis.
               In addition, it suggests that the U.S. public's support for the
               principle of noncombatant immunity is shallow and easily overcome
               by the pressures of war. When considering the use of nuclear
               weapons, the majority of Americans prioritize protecting U.S.
               troops and achieving American war aims, even when doing so would
               result in the deliberate killing of millions of foreign
               noncombatants. A number of individual-level traits—Republican
               Party identification, older age, and approval of the death
               penalty for convicted murderers—significantly increase support
               for using nuclear weapons against Iran. Women are no less willing
               (and, in some scenarios, more willing) than men to support
               nuclear weapons use. These findings highlight the limited extent
               to which the U.S. public has accepted the principles of just war
               doctrine and suggest that public opinion is unlikely to be a

               in line with their material self-interest? The consensus among
               students of public opinion is that material self-interest plays a
               very limited role and that competing non-material factors, such
               as partisanship or ideological predispositions, do most of the
               heavy lifting. This paper moves beyond comparing the role of
               material and non-material factors. Instead, we examine how these
               factors combine to shape policy preferences. Specifically, we
               propose a friendly amendment to Zaller’s influential model
               according to which attitudinal change results from the
               interaction between changes in elite messaging on the one hand
               and individual political predispositions on the other. In
               Zaller’s model, partisanship and ideological predispositions help
               explain why some resist and others embrace new elite messaging.
               We hypothesize that material self-interest also conditions the
               effect of elite messaging. Using British individual-level panel
               data collected over more than a decade, we show that material
               hardship predicts who, among left-wing voters, resist new
               right-wing partisan cues. Our results highlights the incremental
               impact of material self-interest on economic attitudes.",

               retractions from an inexpert source while controlling for

              We conceptualize two ways respondents might think about their ties

              when a respondent believes that when their group is hurt, they are

               policy innovation whose experiments can exacerbate or ameliorate
               racial inequality. In this article, we develop state-level scores

               time-varying, dynamic state-level estimates of racial resentment

              restrictionist positions. However, it is unclear how Latinos make
              decisions when deeply-held issue positions apart from immigration
              conflict with group-relevant policies. In this paper, I design a
              dynamic tailored conjoint experiment that leverages large language
              models (LLMs) to assess whether immigration or core issues
              elicited in an open-ended question are stronger determinants of
              candidate choice. I consistently find that the effects of core
              issue positions on candidate choice are larger than the effects of
              immigration stances across three online samples of Latinos
              conducted on CloudResearch and YouGov (n=2,421). Factors such as
              group identity and proximity to the immigration experience narrow
              -- but rarely close -- the gap between the two issues.",

               the preferences of citizens in a variety of political contexts.
               We propose a method to modify the standard text-only “box
               conjoint” to make the treatment higher in external validity with
               respect to a common target context. Citizens frequently encounter
               political information encoded as images and in particular in the
               form of politicians’ social media posts and profiles. We deploy
               “visual conjoint” experiments where subjects select between two
               images that encode the same explicit information as is standard
               in the box conjoint. We conduct an experiment in which we
               randomize the modality of a conjoint experiment where subjects
               evaluate the Twitter profiles of hypothetical candidates. We
               demonstrate that the visual conjoint more effectively encodes
               image-based information and social endorsement information. The
               visual conjoint also allows the salience of different attributes
               to vary naturally the way they do on social media, in contrast to
               the artificially enforced uniformity of the box conjoint.",

              health outcomes among people who inject drugs (PWID). This study
              investigates the associations of local-level housing and economic
              conditions with homelessness among a large sample of PWID, which
              is an underexplored topic to date. METHODS: PWID in this
              cross-sectional study were recruited from 19 large cities in the
              USA as part of National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. PWID provided
              self-reported information on demographics, behaviours and life
              events. Homelessness was defined as residing on the street, in a
              shelter, in a single room occupancy hotel, or in a car or
              temporarily residing with friends or relatives any time in the
              past year. Data on county-level rental housing unaffordability and
              demand for assisted housing units, and ZIP code-level
              gentrification (eg, index of percent increases in non-Hispanic
              white residents, household income, gross rent from 1990 to 2009)
              and economic deprivation were collected from the US Census Bureau
              and Department of Housing and Urban Development. Multilevel models
              evaluated the associations of local economic and housing
              characteristics with homelessness. RESULTS: Sixty percent
              (5394/8992) of the participants reported homelessness in the past
              year. The multivariable model demonstrated that PWID living in ZIP
              codes with higher levels of gentrification had higher odds of
              homelessness in the past year (gentrification: adjusted OR=1.11,
              95\% CI=1.04 to 1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Additional research is needed
              to determine the mechanisms through which gentrification increases
              homelessness among PWID to develop appropriate community-level
              interventions.",
